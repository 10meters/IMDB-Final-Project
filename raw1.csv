0,1. Whiplash,2014,"A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential. Nineteen-year-old Andrew Niemann wants to be the greatest jazz drummer in the world, in a league with Buddy Rich. This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high-school-teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best. He has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. The other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by Fletcher.—Huggo Andrew Neiman, a 19-year-old jazz drummer is determined to rise to the top of the country's most elite music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons, Juno), an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life. Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability and his sanity.—Loft Cinema Andrew is a drummer and a first year student at the Schaffer Conservatory. He is selected by the school's senior instructor, Mr. Fletcher, to play on his studio band. Fletcher is - to say the least - a difficult and demanding task master who accepts and expects nothing less that perfection from his students. His methods of exacting the best from his students include belittling them, throwing objects at them and creating a level of tension so high that average individuals would likely crumble under the pressure. It leads Andrew to eventually quit but a surprise encounter with Fletcher gives him a chance to show just what he can accomplish - or to fail miserably.—garykmcd With dreams of becoming one of the best jazz drummers in the world, Andrew Neiman enrolls himself into a prestigious music conservatory. His ambition does not go unnoticed, and he is hand-picked, and mentored by the schools senior instructor, Fletcher. Andrew soon realises that Fletcher's terrifying methods will either make, or break him as an artist.—BecksyKane",8.5,"$3,300,000 (estimated)","Miles Teller,J.K.

4,5. Boyhood,2014,"The life of Mason, from early childhood to his arrival at college. Filmed over 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason (a breakthrough performance by Ellar Coltrane), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. Starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason's parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.—IFC Films Twelve years in the less than nuclear life of a nuclear Texas family - father Mason, mother Olivia, oldest offspring Samantha, and youngest offspring Mason Jr. - is presented, focusing on the younger Mason's entire public school years, he sometimes referred to as MJ when in the presence of his father. This phase of their story begins in 2002 when Olivia and Mason, who originally married because she was pregnant, are now divorced, the marriage which was destined to dissolve due to these circumstances. Olivia has custody of the two children, and when he is around, Mason has weekend visitation rights, which has not happened in the last year or so as he stated he, an aspiring musician and somewhat irresponsible young adult, was ""away somewhere in Alaska"" trying to find himself. Olivia wants to eke out a better life for herself and the kids in a way that will also satisfy her own emotional needs. The two parents also try to move on with their sexual and relationship lives in the high probability that they will never reconcile, much against their children's own wants. MJ's growing up is affected by these circumstances and whatever the situation at the time outwardly orchestrated by Olivia (but often manipulated by others), and by his relationship with his family members - who evolve as they each grow up chronologically and emotionally - and others in his ever changing life.—Huggo Following Mason's life from age 6 to 18, Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood"" captures the growing pains of a Texas boy from elementary school to graduation. For twelve long years, uncomfortable decisions, challenging changes, and emotional experiences mould Mason's personality as he grows up in a single-parent family. As life unfolds, vivid vignettes document family gatherings, road trips, birthday parties, graduations and other pivotal milestones, along with in-between episodes. And through Mason's eyes, boyhood slowly turns into adolescence and young adulthood.—Nick Riganas",7.9,"$4,000,000 (estimated)","Ellar Coltrane,Patricia Arquette,Elijah Smith,Lorelei Linklater,Steven Chester Prince,Bonnie Cross,Sydney Orta,Libby Villari,Ethan Hawke,Marco Perella,Jamie Howard,Andrew Villarreal,Shane Graham,Tess Allen,Ryan Power,Sharee Fowler,Mark Finn,Charlie Sexton,Byron Jenkins,Holly Moore,David Blackwell,Barbara Chisholm,Matthew Martinez-Arndt,Cassidy Johnson,Cambell Westmoreland,Jennifer Griffin,Garry Peters,Merrilee McCommas,Tamara Jolaine,Jordan Howard,Andrew Bunten,Tyler Strother,Evie Thompson,Brad Hawkins,Savannah Welch,Mika Odom,Sinjin Venegas,Nick Krause,Derek Chase Hickey,Angela Rawna,Megan Devine,Jenni Tooley,Landon Collier,Roland Ruiz,Richard Andrew Jones,Karen Jones,Gordon Friday,Tom McTigue,Sam Dillon,Martel Summers,David Clark,Zoe Graham,Jessie Tilton,Richard Robichaux,Will Harris,Indica Shaw,Bruce Salmon,Wayne Sutton,Joe Sundell,Sean Tracey,Ben Hodges,Daniel Zeh,Chris Doubek,Andrea McKinnon,Mona Lee Fultz,Bill Wise,Alina Linklater,Charlotte Linklater,Genevieve Kinney,Elijah Ford,Kyle Crusham,Conrad Choucroun,Maximillian McNamara,Taylor Weaver,Jessi Mechler,Virginia Allee,Renne Araujo,Marina Arellano,Brad Ausmus,Greg Baglia,Jonathan Bell,Deanna Brochin,Jayson Champion,Roger Clemens,Lise' Creed,Ken Edwards,Maria Engler,Evan Freeze,Justin Jacobs,Amber Jaycox,Samantha Kelly,Kaitlyn King,Jason Lane,Stephen Latham,Elizabeth Lestina,Alexander Lu,Marian Luntz,Natalie Makenna,Doug Mansolino,Heather Materne,Rissa Medlenka,Craig Alan Ries,Courtney Tailor,Corey Terrell,Lupe Trejo,Johnny Walter",TV-14,Richard Linklater,"Diaphana Distribution,IFC Films,Lumière,Lumière,Toho,Toho-Towa,United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures,Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures,Canvas,Feelgood Entertainment,Film1,ITVX,Lumière Home Entertainment,Lumière Home Entertainment,NBCUniversal Entertainment,NOS Audiovisuais,Paramount Home Entertainment,Paramount Home Entertainment,Paramount Home Entertainment,Pluto TV,Showtime Networks,The Criterion Channel,The Criterion Collection,Universal Home Entertainment,Universal Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Vrijzinnig Protestantse Radio Omroep (VPRO)","IFC Productions,Detour Filmproduction",Drama,165

Carefully observing his fellow travelers along the way, Marks eventually ends up seated next to nervous flyer Jen (Julianne Moore), who begins to breathe easier once she's seated near a window. Later, as the plane hits cruising altitude, Marks receives a mysterious text message stating that a passenger on the flight will be killed every 20 minutes unless $150 million is deposited into a secure bank account. But the harder Marks works to identify a suspect, the deeper he implicates himself in what becomes a deadly hostage crisis unfolding at 30,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean. When it's revealed that the account for the ransom money is in Marks' name, the FAA revokes his marshal status and the media paints him as a hijacker. As the frightened passengers begin to turn on Marks, he suspects the true culprit may not even be on the plane. And with the help of Jen and perceptive airline hostess Nancy (Michelle Dockery), he attempts to clear his name and protect the passengers by any means possible.. With his life slowly falling apart, the Federal Air Marshal, Bill Marks, takes a non-stop transatlantic flight from New York City to London. But, shortly after take-off, Marks starts receiving a series of anonymous text messages from an unseen adversary who is threatening him that, unless $150 million is deposited in a special off-shore account, one passenger on the plane will die every twenty minutes. Now, not knowing who to trust, Bill finds himself in the middle of a dangerous cat-and-mouse game, and the clock is ticking. Who's behind this deadly conspiracy?

Jason has just been dumped, but he didn't even realize they were going out. Meanwhile, Mikey's wife has just asked him for a divorce, and perpetually single Daniel is still single. The three best friends are determined to stay single together and just have fun. But then Jason meets Ellie, who just might be perfect for him, Daniel starts to realize that his gal pal Chelsea might be perfect for him, and Mikey has always thought that his wife was perfect for him. The boys will need to juggle their single life with their romantic entanglements and it will get awkward.—napierslogs Twentysomethings Mikey, a doctor, and Jason and Daniel, who work together as book-cover designers for a publishing house, are best buddies. After Mikey's wife Vera divorces him, having fallen out of love with him and in love with someone else, Jason suggests that the three of them enter into a pact to be single, namely to amass a proverbial little black book of women, each individual woman who each will not see more than twice a week in keeping things casual. Shortly after making this pact, Jason reconnects with an author named Ellie, who he is able to charm despite the misconception by Jason during what ended up being a one-nighter, their resulting relationship which slowly crosses the line of the pact. Daniel and his longtime friend Chelsea--who have acted as each other's wing person in picking up potential sex partners--end up seeing each other in a different, more romantic light. Neither Jason or Daniel want to disclose to their friends what seem to be their burgeoning serious relationships. Conversely, Mike, still pining after Vera, ends up reconnecting with her in ways they hadn't in months, he too reluctant to disclose to his friends what he is doing with his ex-wife. For Daniel and especially Jason, the most ardent bachelor, they have to decide how far they will go to hide or deny their relationships, which if they go too far might actually jeopardize what they truly want in life with who they truly want in life. And Mike has to come to a realization if his reunion with Vera is truly what he wants, or if it is him falling back into the path he had determined with her since they were in college.—Huggo",6.1,"$8,000,000 (estimated)","Zac Efron,Miles Teller,Michael B.

This movie recounts the adventures of M. Gustave, a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel between the wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves the theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune - all against the backdrop of a suddenly and dramatically changing continent.—Fox Searchlight Pictures A teenage girl visits the monument of the writer who penned the book, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". In 1968, that author was inspired to write the book when he visited that hotel, located in the European mountainous country formerly known as Zubrowka. Once a luxurious hotel, it, in 1968, has fallen on hard times. The author meets the then current owner, Mr. Zero Moustafa, who recounts the story of how he became the hotel's owner and why he holds onto it and keeps it open despite it obviously making him no money. Zero's story begins in 1932, when the hotel was in its golden era. Zero was the novice immigrant lobby boy, who, like all the other hotel staff, was under the guidance of M. Gustave, the devoted concierge. Gustave aimed to please, he giving the guests whatever they wanted, especially the wealthy blonde women. The story largely revolves around one of those women, the wealthy Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis - better known as Madame D. - her opportunistic son Dmitri, the bequeathing of a valuable painting called ""Boy with Apple"" to Gustave, the mysterious circumstances surrounding her death which is initially pinned on Gustave, and the attempts of Zero, his girlfriend - a baker's assistant named Agatha - and others to clear Gustave's name while Dmitri does whatever he needs to get what he believes is rightfully his, namely the painting.—Huggo In the far reaches of Eastern Europe in the former Republic of Zubrowka, there once was the Grand Budapest hotel.

A young British soldier is accidentally abandoned by his unit following a terrifying riot on the streets of Belfast in 1971. Unable to tell friend from foe, the raw recruit must survive the night alone and find his way to safety through a disorienting, alien and deadly landscape. 1971. Instead of being sent to Germany after the completion of basic training as they expect, Private Gary Hook and the rest of his regiment with the British Army are deployed early to Belfast, Northern Ireland, where tensions are rising between the Protestant Loyalists and the Catholic Republicans, the latter militarized under the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The regiment's task is largely to maintain the peace within the conflict while the local police do their job related to the conflict. Much of the populace, especially on the Catholic side, will not be happy to see the British Army intervention. While the regiment is dealing with a situation in Belfast that has the potential to escalate into a full blown riot, Hook, due to a specific incident within the situation, is separated from the rest of the regiment. He has to try to make his way back to the barracks on his own, which will be difficult as he doesn't have his bearings within the neighborhood, and as he knows a few young men in particular, they with the Provisional IRA, will shoot to kill him, those within the provisional army who are younger, and generally more willing to take extreme measures for the cause in their inexperience. In the process, Hook will find that many are caught in the middle in some form or another, some who do not believe in the conflict or the potential loss of life regardless of which side they fall on, and some who, despite their official positions, may take what may seem on the surface to be uncharacteristic measures, which may help or hinder Hook, all for their self-serving motives.—Huggo",7.2,,"Jack O'Connell,Jack Lowden,Paul Popplewell,Adam Nagaitis,Joshua Hill,Ben Williams-Lee,Jonah Russell,Harry Verity,Peter McNeil O'Connor,Babou Ceesay,Sam Reid,James McArdle,Sam Hazeldine,Sean Harris,Paul Anderson,Ben Peel,Andy Moore,Amy Molloy,Valene Kane,Aaron Lynch,Barry Keoghan,Tom Cowling,Gerard Jordan,Denise Gough,Martin McCann,Killian Scott,Liam McMahon,Aaron Monaghan,David Wilmot,Dawn Bradfield,Eabha MacCabe,Corey McKinley,Paul Kennedy,Emmet Kirwan,Barry Barnes,Chris Patrick-Simpson,Terence Keeley,Jim Sturgeon,Cathy White,Charlie Murphy,Richard Dormer,Pamela Ashton,Paul Bergquist,Lee Bolton,Jonathan Bridge,Calum C.

33,9. Endless Love,2014,"The story of a privileged girl and a charismatic boy whose instant desire sparks a love affair made only more reckless by parents trying to keep them apart. David has had a crush on Jade since the first time he saw her in the tenth grade. With high school coming to an end, David has never spoken to her until her family pulls up to The Inn, where David works as a valet. She and David fall madly in love, a love that only grows stronger as parents try to tear them apart. David knows Jade's past, but as his secrets are slowly revealed, Jade's trust is tested and leaves them wondering if they are truly meant to be together.—Anonymous Destined to become a cardiologist just like her father, the wealthy and sheltered Jade meets for the first time her rebellious blue-collar classmate, David, on the night of their high school graduation where he works as a valet. As David summons up all his courage to talk to Jade, almost instantly, sparks start to fly, and much to his surprise, for the rest of the summer, the two of them will become inseparable. However, Jade's overprotective and highly disapproving father has other plans for his daughter and he is determined to separate the young lovers at all costs. Will David prove himself worthy of Jade, furthermore, will their love blossom?—Nick Riganas Jade Butterfield and David Elliot have just graduated from the same Atlanta high school, not having spent any time together in the four years of being in the same class. Jade, from a wealthy family - her father, Hugh Butterfield, a cardiologist, and her mother, Anne Butterfield, a published novelist - has willingly had her nose in the books for the four years in the pursuit of following in Hugh's footsteps. Under Hugh's pressure, Jade doing so was largely in memory of her eldest brother, Chris Butterfield, who was supposed to be that cardiologist, but who died in his senior year of high school from cancer. Jade's surviving older brother, Keith Butterfield - who was the middle child - never succumbed to any of their father's pressure, and as such is the neglected offspring. Jade had been seen by her classmates as an ice princess for not socializing with them. Hugh has managed to get Jade an internship over the summer before she heads to Brown in the fall, all these steps on track for her to get into medical school when the time comes. David comes from a blue collar family, his widowed father, Harry Elliot, who runs his own garage. Although academically bright, David has no intention of going to college, he who quite happily would work in the garage as his livelihood. David, who has pined after Jade from afar for the four years, never had the nerve to talk to her. Although he didn't specifically see Jade in that associated role during high school, David aspires to true love, the kind of love he says he witnessed between his parents up until the time his mother passed away. When Jade and David finally have that connection early in the summer, they quickly begin to fall for each other. They decide to spend whatever time they have over the summer together before Jade leaves, they living in the moment with no real plans for a ""them"" at Jade's departure. Anne wants Jade to experience her first love with David to the fullest, whether it be the puppy or true variety, and Keith is happy about how happy David makes Jade, unlike the four years of high school when she really wasn't truly happy. But working against a Jade/David happy ending are David's old girlfriend, fellow classmate Jenny who secretly is working on getting David back, and Hugh, who will do whatever it takes to see that David does not ruin his plan for Jade's life, regardless of how hypocritical his talk and actions are.—Huggo Beautiful-but-shy Atlanta native Jade Butterfield, age 17, has not made any friends throughout her four years of high school. She has missed a social life in favor of studies, wanting to do well in memory of her eldest brother Chris - who died from cancer. David Elliot, another graduating senior, has had a crush on her since they were both freshmen, yet he never had the courage to act on said crush. Jade - along with her elder brother Keith, and their parents Hugh and Anne - stop at an upscale restaurant where David works as a parking valet. When Jade drops her (empty) yearbook, David retrieves it, mentions that they were classmates and agrees to sign it. Inside the restaurant, Jade asks her parents for a graduation party. When Anne and Hugh approve, Jade excitedly invites David. David thrills Jade by taking her on a brief joyride in the car of a snobby guest - partly in retaliation for the guest's demeaning behavior toward David's best friend Mace, another valet.

51,2. Captain America: The Winter Soldier,2014,"As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with a fellow Avenger and S.H.I.E.L.D agent, Black Widow, to battle a new threat from history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier. For Steve Rogers, awakening after decades of suspended animation involves more than catching up on pop culture; it also means that this old school idealist must face a world of subtler threats and difficult moral complexities. That becomes clear when Director Nick Fury is killed by the mysterious assassin, the Winter Soldier, but not before warning Rogers that SHIELD has been subverted by its enemies. When Rogers acts on Fury's warning to trust no one there, he is branded as a traitor by the organization. Now a fugitive, Captain America must get to the bottom of this deadly mystery with the help of the Black Widow and his new friend, The Falcon. However, the battle will be costly for the Sentinel of Liberty, with Rogers finding enemies where he least expects them while learning that the Winter Soldier looks disturbingly familiar.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Steve Rogers is coming to grips with living in modern America after being frozen in ice for 70 years. A new threat against S.H.I.E.L.D. arises called ""The Winter Soldier"". While the origins of the Winter Soldier are unknown, the threat against S.H.I.E.L.D. from the Hydra organization is. Especially after it compromises Nick Fury and Agent Romanoff, leaving them betrayed and left for dead, and their S.H.I.E.L.D. status revoked, marking them as traitors to the organization. Now racing against time with very little resources available at his disposal, Captain America launches an investigation into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s origins and that has him returning to the very Army base where he once underwent basic training nearly 100 years ago. What he and Romanoff discover there leads to a very startling development with S.H.I.E.L.D., a top secret project called ""Operation Insight"", and the launch of the next generation of Helicarrier. Can they stop it before it's too late?—halo1k Steve Rogers, finding it easier to acclimate to the modern society as a soldier of SHIELD, learns that the organization has been compromised and a Soviet assassin known as The Winter Soldier will stop at nothing to kill Captain America, which leads him uncover a truth that will change everything. Two years after the alien attack on New York, Steve Rogers starts to adjust to the modern world and works as an agent of SHIELD. However, Steve disagrees with the rules of today as he faces a world of threats and complexities. When Director Nick Fury is killed by a mysterious assassin called the Winter Soldier, Steve is warned not to trust anyone, only to find himself being framed for not sharing information. On the run, Rogers launches an investigation into a deadly conspiracy which reveals that SHIELD has been infiltrated by his old arch nemesis HYDRA, who have been hiding in plain sight. With only Black Widow and Falcon as backup, Rogers must once again suit up and defeat HYDRA from launching their ultimate weapon before it's too late.—Blazer346",7.7,"$170,000,000 (estimated)","Chris Evans,Samuel L.

52,3. Chef,2014,"A head chef quits his restaurant job and buys a food truck in an effort to reclaim his creative promise, while piecing back together his estranged family. Carl Casper is an acclaimed chef with a family life that seems as decaying as his artistic freedom. Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl's ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Miami-born Carl Casper is the head chef of Gauloise in Brentwood, California. While popular with his kitchen staff and hostess Molly, the restaurant owner Riva wants Carl to stick to ""classics"" rather than innovative dishes. Carl has a strained relationship with his tech-savvy preteen son Percy and rich ex-wife Inez. When Carl has the chance to serve prestigious critic and blogger Ramsey Michel, Riva demands he stick with old favorites at the last minute; Carl concedes, leading to a scathing review. On Twitter, Carl insults Ramsey for the review, not realizing that his reply is public, and gains a large Twitter following. Carl comes up with a new menu that his staff loves and invites Ramsey to a ""rematch""; however, he quits after confronting Riva, who wants the old menu again.. Los Angeles-based executive chef Carl Casper was once deemed the one to watch within the business. But years working for Riva at upscale Gauloise, Riva who promised him creative control but who has ended up dictating that he cater the menu and his cooking to the tastes of the masses, Carl has lost that promise, although his staff, including his sous chef Tony, the sommelier Molly, but especially one of the line cooks Martin, still admire his talent. Carl may not realize how much this stifling has affected his psyche, that negativity which led to the dissolution of his marriage to Inez, and he having a strained relationship with his and Inez's ten year old son Percy, who only wants to spend quality time with his physically present but mentally absent father in their mandated time together. In being a social media newbie, Carl ends up having a very public breakdown. In the aftermath, Carl, with nothing else he wants to do but be a chef, has to reinvent himself in some manner to get back on his feet. He decides to take Inez up a long standing offer concerning her first husband, Miami-based entrepreneur Marvin who has a hygiene fetish. Despite not fully trusting Marvin, Carl may rediscover his passion for cooking and in the process his passion for life in general, that passion which may bring those things of importance that he has lost in the ten years back.—Huggo Carl Casper is a disillusioned chef fed up with his restaurant's management, poor reviews and lack of creativity. After an online battle with a well-known critic leads to further frustration, Carl decides to leave and go solo as a food truck operator in a bid to rediscover his flair for cooking.",7.3,"$11,000,000 (estimated)","Jon Favreau,John Leguizamo,Bobby Cannavale,Emjay Anthony,Scarlett Johansson,Dustin Hoffman,Sofía Vergara,Oliver Platt,Amy Sedaris,Robert Downey Jr.,Russell Peters,Chase Grimm,Will Schutze,Gloria Sandoval,Jose C.

53,4. Noah,2014,"Noah is chosen by God to undertake a momentous mission before an apocalyptic flood cleanses the world. ""In the beginning, there was nothing."" So starts this version of the story centered on Noah (Russell Crowe), the man entrusted by God to save the innocent animals of Earth as the rising floodwaters cleansed the planet of mankind's evil. As the telling continues, we learn how Adam and Eve's sins have passed down through generations through their sons Cain and Abel, and how the descendants of their righteous sibling Seth were entrusted with defending creation. One day, while foraging in the country, a descendant of Seth, Noah, sees his father slain by a descendant of Cain. In the process, Noah's birthright is stolen from him. Decades later, as a father of three, Noah experiences a vision foretelling the great flood that will wash over the Earth, destroying every living thing that stands on the soil. That vision leads Noah to seek out his grandfather, Methuselah (Sir Anthony Hopkins), in order to understand his mission. When a second vision reveals that Noah is to construct a massive ark designed to shelter every living animal during the great flood, Noah, his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), their three sons Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman), and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll), and their adoptive sister Ila (Emma Watson) immediately begin construction on the vessel with the help of the Watchers, a race of angels created as beings of light, but encrusted in stone and mud and forsaken by God for their attempts to help man. Meanwhile, word of Noah's work soon reaches Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone), who gathers an army on a mission to overtake the ark, and survive the coming storm by any cost.",5.8,"$125,000,000 (estimated)","Russell Crowe,Jennifer Connelly,Ray Winstone,Anthony Hopkins,Emma Watson,Logan Lerman,Douglas Booth,Nick Nolte,Mark Margolis,Kevin Durand,Leo McHugh Carroll,Marton Csokas,Finn Wittrock,Madison Davenport,Gavin Casalegno,Nolan Gross,Skylar Burke,Dakota Goyo,Ariane Rinehart,Adam Griffith,Sophie Nyweide,Don Harvey,Sami Gayle,Barry Sloane,Ezra Barnes,Arna Magnea Danks,Vera Fried,Thor Kjartansson,Gregg Bello,Mellie Maissa Rei Campos,Oliver Lee Saunders,Frank Langella,Joe Barlam,Joseph Basile,Gabriel F.

His ex-partner, learning of the plan, places a massive bounty on his head as the race begins. Framed by an ex-partner for a murder he did not commit, Tobey Marshall, a financially struggling custom-car builder and street-racer, spends two years in jail thinking about one moment. Fresh out of prison he reacquires the fastest car his workshop ever built and sold, and seeks to enter a secretive and extremely high-stakes race known as The DeLeon.

Released from prison two years later, the vengeful Marshall plots to prove his mettle by winning the De Leon -- an illicit race showcasing the country's top underground talents. But getting to the De Leon will be no simple task, because not only has the ruthless Brewster put a bounty on Marshall's prized car, but the police are hot on his trail during the white-knuckle, coast-to-coast dash.

He must decide what he's willing to sacrifice on a life-changing day for a few hundred young men with NFL dreams. It's draft day in the NFL, and as General Manager of the Cleveland Browns, Sonny is forced to come up with a big move. After trading for the number one pick, Sonny has to choose between a lower-ranked linebacker with a questionable past, or a celebrated quarterback with a questionable future. All the while, Sonny is walking in the footsteps of his father, and personal complications force their way to the surface.—Anne Campbell Sonny Weaver, Jr., the General Manager of the Cleaveland Browns, has a lot to think about on draft day. The team's owner Anthony is concerned with the teams' commercial viability. The head coach has raised the new signings he wants. The players attached to the Browns have their thoughts on the draft. Sonny's role is under the microscope after he fired his father, Sonny Weaver, Sr., from the position of head coach, the previous season. Now with things settling into his hands, will Sonny go for the ""splash"" signing Bo Callahan as wanted by Anthony, will he relent to the needs of the head coach, or does he have his own plans?—Thejus Joseph Jose With 13 hours until the beginning of the NFL draft, Sonny is informed by the team's owner (Frank Langella) that if Sonny doesn't make a splash and generate ticket sales, he's going to be fired. That prompts the GM to take a trade offer from another team that gives him the first pick in the draft, in exchange for three future first-round picks. The move outrages the Browns' head coach, and forces all of the team's scouts to dig up what they can find about the pick everyone, including the owner, expects them to make -- a highly touted QB from Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Weaver is drawn to a talented linebacker who has family issues to deal with and is known for having a hot temper.. Sonny Weaver Jr. is the general manager of the Cleveland Browns and today is Draft Day and such a day is set on a grand stage. The teams owner seems to be at wits end with the teams commercial-ability and lack of winning lately and appears to be putting an immense amount of scrutiny on Sonny's every move. He needs to make a HUGE splash not only for the betterment of his franchise but for the security of his position. Sonny is left with a crucial decision, go for the gusto and draft the big name QB whose playing ability is celebrated everywhere he's been but has a high chance to bust or go back to the basics and draft the lower ranked linebacker with a muddled past but a pure love for the game that could be the framework of a well rounded powerhouse. To leave his current QB as an afterthought or to build off of the surprisingly solid culture the team already possesses. Sonny has always been backed into a corner of which the successful reputation his father garnered before him but now the choice is his and solely his despite the detesting nature of the owner and loud polarizing coach.

However, in their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed-to be a participant in his own transcendence. For his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and best friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should.

81,7. Heaven Is for Real,2014,"A small-town father must find the courage and conviction to share his son's extraordinary, life-changing experience with the world. This is the story of a small-town father who must find the courage and conviction to share his son Colton's extraordinary life-changing experience with the world. Colton claims to have visited Heaven during a near-death experience. Colton recounts the details of his amazing journey with childlike innocence and speaks matter-of-factly about things that happened before his birth - things he couldn't possibly know. Todd and his family are challenged to examine the meaning of this remarkable event. The church turns on him and so does everyone who is close to him - including his wife.—Sony Pictures Publicity When their young son Colton (Connor Corum) enters the hospital with a life-threatening illness, devastated parents Todd (Academy Award nominee Greg Kinnear) and Sonja Burpo (Kelly Reilly) don't know if he'll make it out of the operating room alive. But in what Colton's doctors credit as ""a miracle,"" he survives - with an incredible story that seems to confirm the existence of heaven. Later, despite Colton's accurate and intimate revelations about people he has never encountered - including his sister who died in utero and his late grandfather -skeptics hastily dismiss any possibility that the young boy's fantastical claims could be true. Meanwhile, his astonished parents seek meaning in the alleged miracle that has turned their once-peaceful lives completely upside-down. Preacher and entrepreneur Todd Burpo enjoys running his parish, starring in the baseball team, and raising his young family. Then bad luck strikes: first he is temporarily disabled by a leg injury during a match; then during a family trip to Denver, an infection nearly kills his young son Colton. The boy makes a surprising total recovery after a near-death experience, which he remembers in every detail; afterwards he keeps displaying impossible knowledge, allegedly from heaven, where he met Todd's late father and his own unborn sister. Only Todd stands by his boy and the implied claim of a miracle, which estranges everyone else from them in parish and family, who dismiss such supernatural possibility, challenging Todd's fitness for the ministry.—KGF Vissers Todd and Sonja Burpo provide much service to their community in the farming town of Imperial, Nebraska, whether it be as pastor and his wife at the local church, Todd as a volunteer firefighter, or he, even in his own garage door repair business, accepting payment in goods or services instead of money by those who cannot afford to pay. Despite the church providing them with a house - albeit located close to the railroad tracks, so not ideal - they are in a tight financial situation, wanting to persevere on their own rather than ask for help, an offer which has come from the one person in the know, Todd's best friend, banker Jay Wilkins, and which Todd turns down. They must rush their younger child, 4-year-old Colton, to the hospital for emergency surgery for what is ultimately diagnosed as a ruptured appendix. At first it looks like he won't make it, but he does end up fully recovering. He starts innocently relaying his remembrances during surgery, and he sounds like he had an out-of-body experience and actually visited heaven. This is against Todd's understanding of life, but he can at least entertain the notion as Colton talks of things he would never have known otherwise - could he really have visited heaven, especially since he never actually died on the operating table? Todd's own quest for truly understanding what happened to Colton, especially in not wanting to dismiss Colton's reality as fantasy, begins to place him at odds with many in his congregation, who believe his quest for that understanding is taking away from his role as pastor to them, and arguably more importantly with Sonja, who wants Todd to focus on the realities of the here and now of what it means to survive as a family.—Huggo",5.9,"$12,000,000 (estimated)","Greg Kinnear,Kelly Reilly,Thomas Haden Church,Connor Corum,Lane Styles,Margo Martindale,Jacob Vargas,Thanya Romero,Danso Gordon,Rob Moran,Nancy Sorel,Darcy Fehr,Vivian Winther,Pete Hudson,Ursula Clark,Mike Mohrhardt,Bryan Terrell Clark,Randy Apostle,Julia Arkos,Candace Smith,Cruise Brown,Keenan Lehmann,Michael Mills,Kevin Anderson,Jon Ted Wynne,Darren Felbel,Lois Brothers,Mike Bell,Susan Kelso,Amber Lynn Partridge,John B.

An alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Major William Cage (Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt). And, as Cage and Vrataski take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy!—Warner Bros.

General Brigham plans an attack to France expecting to defeat the Mimics and orders Major William Cage, who is an American public relation officer, to cover the invasion. However Cage does not accept the assignment and threatens General Brigham to expose the casualties. He is arrested, accused of desertion, demoted to private and assigned to fight in the invasion under the command of the tough Sergeant Farell in the Heathrow Base. Humans are slaughtered in the invasion and Cage kills a Mimic and is sprayed by his blood; in less than five minutes combat, Cage dies. Surprisingly he awakes in the Heathrow Base and relives the same day over and over after dieing. Each time, Cage tries to fix the deaths of his squad and he meets Sergeant Rita Vrataski who asks him to find her when he awakes in the base. Rita brings Cage to meet Dr. Carter who explains to him that he killed an Alpha and his blood has given the ability to reset time. Further, the last hope of earth is the destruction of the Mimic leader, referred to as the Omega, who is hidden. Will Cage and Rita succeed in their solitary mission?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Before the numbing technological superiority of the omnipotent extraterrestrial menace known only as the ""Mimics"", mankind stands helpless, doomed to accept an ignoble fate.

When the unseasoned officer, Major William Cage, learns firsthand the magnitude of the problem with his own life, he quickly realises that death is only the beginning--each blood-drenched battle with the formidable foes brings him back to square one, only with a dash of improvement in his fighting capacity. Perhaps now, Cage, his legendary brother-in-arms, Rita Vrataski, and the rest of the world have a fighting chance against the otherworldly opponent.

102,3. Maleficent,2014,"A vengeful fairy is driven to curse an infant princess, only to discover that the child could be the one person who can restore peace to their troubled land. A beautiful, pure-hearted young woman, Maleficent has an idyllic life growing up in a peaceable forest kingdom, until the day an invading army threatens the harmony of the land. Maleficent rises to be the land's fiercest protector, but she ultimately suffers a ruthless betrayal--an act that turns her pure heart to stone. Bent on revenge, Maleficent faces a battle with the invading king's successor; as a result she places a curse upon his newborn daughter Aurora. As the child grows, Maleficent realizes that Aurora holds the key to peace in the kingdom--and perhaps to Maleficent's true happiness as well.—Walt Disney Pictures Reared in the enchanted forests of the Moors--the magical realm on the outskirts of a rival human kingdom--Maleficent, the magnificent winged fairy of pure heart, experiences for the first time the intoxicating effect of a youthful romance. But, soon, the frail age of innocence will come to an end--and as a despicable act of betrayal blemishes forever the young sprite's sensitive soul--an all-powerful dark Maleficent emerges; the mighty defender of the Moors. Now, bitterness, anger, and a rabid desire for retribution fill the void in Maleficent's heart--no one is safe from harm; especially the king's newborn daughter, Aurora, who must suffer for the sins of her father. Once, a cherished one used the healing force of noble feelings against Maleficent. Could now true love stop the Mistress of All Evil?—Nick Riganas Maleficent once ruled the moors with a kind heart, but everything changes for her when she befriends Stefan.

103,4. X-Men: Days of Future Past,2014,"The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. In the future, the mutants and the humans who help them are slaughtered by powerful robots named Sentinels. Professor Xavier, Wolverine, Magneto, Storm, Kitty Pryde, and her friends meet at a monastery in China and Xavier explains that the invincible Sentinels were created using the DNA of Mystique that was captured in 1973 when she tried to assassinate their creator Dr. Bolivar Trask. Xavier tells that their only chance is return to 1973 using Pryde's ability to join Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr to convince Mystique to give up her intention. However, only Wolverine can withstand the damages of the time travel. Will he succeed in stopping Mystique and the Sentinel Program, and save the mutants and their human friends from annihilation?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil This movie opens in a dark and desolate future that was set in motion in 1973, when brilliant scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) created a series of giant robots called Sentinels for the sole purpose of wiping out mutants, who he claimed were a direct threat to the human race. Although initially programmed solely to target mutants, the Sentinels soon began eradicating humans who possessed the DNA to breed mutants, and eventually, any mortal mutant sympathizers. Desperate, Professor Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) devise a plan to have Kitty Pryde (Elliot Page) send Wolverine back to the year when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Trask. It turns out that Mystique inadvertently accelerated the Sentinel program when she was subsequently captured by Sergeant William Stryker (Josh Helman), who succeeded at harvesting her DNA to make the robots more powerful than ever before. Upon arriving in the past, Wolverine quickly seeks out a much younger Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), as well as Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and together they help break a young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) out of a heavily fortified prison cell hundreds of feet beneath the Pentagon. Meanwhile, with the help of Havok, Ink, Toad, and Spike, Mystique is already moving in for the kill. Although Wolverine, Beast, Charles, and Magneto manage to thwart the assassination, Charles and Magneto once again find themselves at odds after the latter attempts to alter the plan at the last moment, creating a mass panic during a post-Vietnam War peace summit in Paris. And Dr. Trask, still fuming from having had the Sentinel program rejected by Congress, takes his proposal directly to President Nixon (Mark Camacho), laying the groundwork for an even darker future than the one Wolverine was sent back to prevent. In a dystopian 2023, years after Logan's adventure in The Wolverine (2013), Bolivar Trask's powerful mutant-hunting robots, the Sentinels, have brought both mutant-supporters and the meta-human race on the brink of extinction. To avert total annihilation, an aged Professor X, his long-standing friend/nemesis, Magneto, and the remaining survivors of the original team in X-Men (2000) join forces with their 1973 versions from X-Men: First Class (2011), as the body-regenerating Wolverine travels back in time, entrusted with fulfilling a life-or-death mission. Now, the shape-shifting Mystique is caught in the middle of a desperate situation. Can one man alone change the entire course of history?—Nick Riganas The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods in this movie.

106,7. Godzilla,2014,"The world is beset by the appearance of monstrous creatures, but one of them may be the only one who can save humanity. In 1999, the Janjira nuclear plant was mysteriously destroyed with most hands lost including supervisor Joe Brody's colleague and wife, Sandra. Years later, Joe's son, Ford, a US Navy ordnance disposal officer, must go to Japan to help his estranged father who obsessively searches for the truth of the incident. In doing so, father and son discover the disaster's secret cause on the wreck's very grounds. This enables them to witness the reawakening of a terrible threat to all of Humanity, which is made all the worse with a second secret revival elsewhere. Against this cataclysm, the only hope for the world may be Godzilla, but the challenge for the King of the Monsters will be great even as Humanity struggles to understand the destructive ally they have.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In 1999, in Japan, there is a mysterious accident with the reactors of the Janjira nuclear power plant and the engineer Joe Brody loses his wife Sandra Brody and her team that were inspecting the reactor. Joe never accepts the official explanation for the accident. Fifteen years later, his son, the US Navy Officer Ford Brody, learns that Joe has trespassed in Janjira quarantine area and is arrested in Japan. He travels to Japan to release his father and they go to the Janjira facility area to retrieve Joe's data and pictures. Soon they discover the truth about the accident, caused by a ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"" (""MUTO"") that eats radiation trapped underground. The MUTO escapes from the secret facility to Honolulu killing Joe. Godzilla is also awakened, causes a tsunami in Hawaii and fights against the MUTO destroying Honolulu. Meanwhile a female MUTO escapes from the Nevada nuclear waste facility and destroys Las Vegas, heading to breed with the first MUTO in San Francisco. Now the last hope on Earth is Godzilla fighting and destroying the MUTO's.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil When mankind found an ancient spore, they began to preserved until nearly 15 years, it hatches. Now with maloevent terrestrial organisms threatening the existence of man kind, an ancient creature from the depts of the ocean, will rise again to fulfill natures order to restore its balance, while also making sure mankind never makes the same mistakes again. As the story opens in Japan, we find dedicated nuclear power-plant manager Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) so caught up in his work that he forgets it's his birthday. Sending his young son Ford off to school before reporting to the plant with his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche), who works in the reactor, Joe begins to suspect that some suspiciously patterned seismic activity may be something more sinister than shifting tectonic plates He's right, too, because when the plant goes into meltdown mode and Sandra gets caught on the wrong side of the containment door, a massive cover-up ensues. Fifteen years later, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has become a bomb-disposal expert in the U.S. military. He's just returned home to his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and their son Sam (Carson Bolde) when he gets word that Joe been arrested in Japan. Long estranged from his father, who was written off as a conspiracy theorist for his failed efforts to prove the Japanese government was attempting to hide something about the earlier disaster, Ford nevertheless ventures to Japan to get him out of jail, and reluctantly agrees to join him in traveling to their old home in the quarantined zone. Subsequently taken into custody, the pair end up in the very plant where Joe used to work, and where scientists Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) are studying a massive cocoon-like structure that appears to feed on radiation. The situation turns critical when the events of the present begin to mirror those of the past, and a terrifying winged-creature dubbed a ""MUTO"" is unleashed. Meanwhile, as the military attempts to devise a plan to destroy the beast, signals indicate that it had been calling out to something before it broke free, and the scientists learn that it has awoken a towering, godlike leviathan that has lied dormant for centuries, and may be mankind's only hope for restoring the balance of nature..",6.4,"$160,000,000 (estimated)","Aaron Taylor-Johnson,CJ Adams,Ken Watanabe,Bryan Cranston,Elizabeth Olsen,Carson Bolde,Sally Hawkins,Juliette Binoche,David Strathairn,Richard T.

108,9. A Million Ways to Die in the West,2014,"As a cowardly farmer begins to fall for the mysterious new woman in town, he must put his newly found courage to the test when her husband, a notorious gun-slinger, announces his arrival. Set in 1882 in the American west, Albert is a lowly farmer with a nice girlfriend. But when she leaves him for the more successful and handsome owner of a moustachery store, Albert returns to his lonely daily life of trying to avoid death. Then the mysterious Anna rides into town and captures Albert's interest and heart, but with her deadly husband in town, Albert is going to have to become the western gun-slinging hero he never was. It won't be easy because there are a million ways to die in the west.—Anne Campbell 1882. Albert Stark, a mild mannered sheep farmer living outside of Old Stump, Arizona, hates everything about living in this time and place, especially the literally million ways he and others can easily die every day without a care, from shoot-outs, to bar brawls, to bites by rattlesnakes hiding in outhouses, to affliction by any one of numerous untreatable plagues and pestilences. He is also not adept at shooting guns, which makes the death by shoot-outs even more likely, and is the reason why he cowers out of a shoot-out with someone to whom he owes money. Although she states otherwise, the shoot-out is arguably the last straw for Louise, Albert's vain girlfriend, who breaks up with him. Her ""it's not you, it's me"" reason rings false as she quickly starts up with mustachioed Foy, the wealthy owner of a mustache grooming products store, he who Albert knows he cannot compete in not being wealthy enough to be able to grow a groomed mustache. Albert is befriended by Anna, along with her ""brother"" Lewis who are new to Old Stump, and she who is self-admittedly ""smokin' hot"". Anna vows to help Albert with many issues in his life, most specifically in getting Louise back largely by pretending to be his girlfriend to make Louise jealous, and learning how to shoot in what ends up being a challenge to a shoot-out with Foy for Louise's hand. As Albert and Anna start to fall for each other in the process, Anna has to decide if and when she will tell him the truth: that she is already married, albeit unhappily, to Clinch Leatherwood, a vicious outlaw who, along with his gang, she and Lewis are waiting for in Old Stump. Albert, in turn, has to decide when he will become a real man in doing what he needs for what, or who, he truly wants in life.—Huggo Constantly terrified, the meek and lily-livered sheep farmer, Albert Stark, mainly struggles to stay out of trouble in dusty and dangerous 1880s Arizona, utterly convinced that everything out there can and will kill him. And then, for a good reason, Albert gets dumped by his charming girlfriend, Louise, only to fall head over heels in love with the intriguingly mysterious, horse-riding and pistol-packing stranger, Anna. Unexpectedly, Anna and Albert have a genuine connection--and as our unassuming hero learns the fundamentals of survival in the inhospitable wild west--an ironic, yet grave challenge against an unforeseen and mighty adversary demands that he puts to the test his newly found abilities. But, just how many ways to die are there in the west?—Nick Riganas The American West, 1880s. A passive, shy sheep farmer tries to avoid conflict, a trait which has kept him alive but has now resulted in his girlfriend leaving him. She is now with a dapper, successful, extroverted store owner, Foy, a fact Foy keeps reminding him of. When the rivalry leads to a duel, he gets help from an unexpected, beautiful source.—grantss",6.1,"$40,000,000 (estimated)","Seth MacFarlane,Charlize Theron,Amanda Seyfried,Liam Neeson,Giovanni Ribisi,Neil Patrick Harris,Sarah Silverman,Christopher Hagen,Wes Studi,Matt Clark,Evan Jones,Aaron McPherson,Rex Linn,Brett Rickaby,Alex Borstein,Ralph Garman,John Aylward,Jay Patterson,Amick Byram,Dennis Haskins,Christopher Lloyd,Gilbert Gottfried,Ewan McGregor,John Michael Higgins,Julius Sharpe,Mike Miller,Ardy Brent Carlson,Alec Sulkin,Tatanka Means,Ivan Brutsche,Jean Effron,Bob Jesser,Dylan Kenin,Frank Spencer,Mike A.

110,11. Foxcatcher,2014,"U.S. Olympic wrestling champions and brothers Mark Schultz and Dave Schultz join ""Team Foxcatcher"", led by eccentric multi-millionaire John du Pont, as they train for the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, but John's self-destructive behavior threatens to consume them all. Based on true events, Foxcatcher tells the dark and fascinating story of the unlikely and ultimately tragic relationship between an eccentric multi-millionaire and two champion wrestlers. When Olympic Gold Medal winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is invited by wealthy heir John Du Pont (Steve Carell) to move on to the Du Pont estate and help form a team to train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics at his new state-of-the-art training facility, Schultz jumps at the opportunity, hoping to focus on his training and finally step out of the poverty stricken situation Olympic caliber athletes like he and his revered brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo). Driven by hidden needs, Du Pont sees backing Schultz's bid for Gold and the chance to ""coach"" a world-class wrestling team as an opportunity to gain the elusive respect of his peers and, more importantly, his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Trapped in Du Pont's majestic but suffocating world, Mark comes to see his benefactor as an egotistical, arrogant, and selfish megalomaniac and grows increasingly contemptuous. Though initially supportive, Du Pont's mercurial personality turns and he begins to lure Mark into an unhealthy lifestyle that threatens to undermine his training. Soon Du Pont's erratic behavior and threatening psychological game-play begin to erode the athlete's environment, stability, and motivation. Meanwhile Du Pont becomes fixated on Dave, who exudes the confidence Du Pont lacks. Du Pont eventually realizes he is unable to buy the respect he so desperately desires from the world's greatest wrestlers. Fueled by Du Pont's increasing paranoia and alienation from the brothers, the trio is propelled towards a tragedy no one could have foreseen.—Sony Pictures Classics Dave Schultz and Mark Schultz are brothers, Olympic gold medal winning wrestlers (both from the Soviet-bloc boycotted 1984 Olympics), and training partners. As the older who had earlier success, Dave has always been the leader between the two, Mark largely in his shadow, even in his own successes which are seen largely as Dave's doing. In 1987, Mark is recruited by fifty year old John du Pont - of the chemical company du Ponts - to train under his tutelage at his family's estate, Foxcatcher, which du Pont would use as the name for his camp of athletes. Despite not knowing anything about du Pont, Mark is convinced largely out of John's sense of nationalism and seeming pride for the sport, greater public exposure which he feels would give Mark and the sport the glory they so rightly deserve, especially in the United States. In addition, du Pont would largely give Mark free reign to choose his training partners. Dave is offered the same deal through Mark, but turns it down as he does not want to uproot his family to move to the Foxcatcher estate in Pennsylvania. du Pont sees himself as a Renaissance man and philanthropist, his other interests including ornithology, about which he is a published author, philately, and being a freestyle wrestler in his own right. In the short term, Mark, Dave and John all have the same goal: Mark winning the 1987 World Championship and the gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Despite they having these same goals, other priorities for what they are doing, especially du Pont's, would tear the relationship between the three apart, most specifically as du Pont feels like he is loosing control in front of a worldwide audience, which is all the more important seeing as to his relationship with his mother, Jean du Pont.—Huggo Docudrama about millionaire John Du Pont (Steve Carell) and his relationship with brothers Dave (Mark Ruffalo) and Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), Olympic gold-medal wrestlers who train at his estate. Mark initially idolizes Du Pont, but slowly realizes the depths of his benefactor's madness.

113,14. Pride,2014,"U.K. gay activists work to help miners during their lengthy strike of the National Union of Mineworkers in the summer of 1984. In 1984, 20-year-old closet gay Joe hesitantly arrives in London from Bromley for his first Gay Pride march and is taken under the collective wing of a group of gay men and Lesbian Steph, who meet at the Soho bookshop of flamboyant Jonathan and his Welsh partner Gethin. Not only are gays being threatened by Thatcher, but also the miners are on strike in response to her pit closures, and Northern Irish activist Mark Ashton believes that gays and miners should show solidarity. Almost by accident, a minibus-load of gays find themselves in the Welsh village of Onllwyn in the Dulais valley, and through their sincere fundraising and Jonathan's nifty disco moves persuade most of the community that they are on the same side. When a bigot tries to sabotage the partnership with a tabloid smear Mark turns it back on her with a hugely-successful benefit concert to which most of the villagers, now thoroughly in tune with their gay friends, turn up. The miners are defeated and return to work, but at the Pride march the following year a vast contingent of miners show up to repay their comrades with their show of support.—don @ minifie-1 In the summer of 1984, Margaret Thatcher is in power and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is on strike.

114,15. Maps to the Stars,2014,"A tour into the heart of a Hollywood family chasing celebrity, one another and the relentless ghosts of their pasts. The Weiss family is the archetypical Hollywood dynasty: father Stafford is an analyst and coach, who has made a fortune with his self-help manuals; mother Cristina mostly looks after the career of their son Benjie, 13, a child star. One of Stafford's clients, Havana, is an actress who dreams of shooting a remake of the movie that made her mother, Clarice, a star in the 60s. Clarice is dead now and visions of her come to haunt Havana at night... Adding to the toxic mix, Benjie has just come off a rehab program he joined when he was 9 and his sister, Agatha, has recently been released from a sanatorium where she was treated for criminal pyromania and befriended a limo driver Jerome who is also an aspiring actor.—New_Rodro The Weisses are current Hollywood royalty. Father Dr. Stafford Weiss is a celebrity psychotherapist to the stars and self-help guru through his books, videos and seminars. Perhaps more famous is his thirteen year old son, Benjie Weiss, the literal and figurative bad boy star of the hit movie Bad Babysitter and its currently filming sequel. The sequel is a comeback of sorts for Benjie following a highly publicized stint in drug rehab. His career is managed by his mother/Stafford's wife, Christina Weiss. Among Stafford's celebrity clients is actress Havana Segrand, who is also from Hollywood royalty as her mother is actress Clarice Taggart, who died years ago in a house fire. Middle aged Havana is past her star prime, and is hoping her next movie will be the remake of Stolen Waters in the role made famous by her mother and for which Clarice received an Oscar nomination. Havana is largely in therapy because she feels that she was abused by Clarice, who still haunts her as a seemingly real vision, but she may have equally strong emotional issues related to her declining career and how she perceives she is viewed in Hollywood. Through a loose connection with Carrie Fisher, Havana hires new Hollywood arrival, late teen Agatha, as her personal assistant. Havana, Carrie and Agatha believe this connection is karmic as Agatha has physical burn scars on her face and over much of her body, which she hides under her clothes and gloves. Agatha embarks on a friendship/relationship with Jerome Fontana, an aspiring actor/writer who is working as a limo driver until his big break. Like many in his position, he hopes to use whatever life experience to work into his movie career. Although they all have these public issues, there are many secret issues with which they are dealing and which affect their behavior and well being. Agatha's reason for coming to Hollywood in particular may have a profound effect on all those with who she comes into contact.—Huggo Benjie (Evan Bird), a child star, is shaken when his schizophrenic sister (Mia Wasikowska) is released from a mental hospital and returns to Los Angeles, turning the convoluted world of shallow, selfish celebrities and their minions upside down.",6.2,"$15,000,000 (estimated)","Julianne Moore,Mia Wasikowska,John Cusack,Evan Bird,Olivia Williams,Robert Pattinson,Kiara Glasco,Sarah Gadon,Dawn Greenhalgh,Jonathan Watton,Jennifer Gibson,Gord Rand,Justin Kelly,Niamh Wilson,Clara Pasieka,Emilia McCarthy,Allegra Fulton,Domenic Ricci,Jayne Heitmeyer,Sean G Robertson,Ari Cohen,Joe Pingue,Christian Lloyd,Donald Burda,Carrie Fisher,Amanda Brugel,Alden Adair,David Amito,Dan Lett,Sandra Battaglini,Joanne Reece,Chris Anton,George Nickolas K.,Joseph Murray,Adrienne Wilson,Murray Furrow,Neil Girvan,Shane Clinton Jarvis,Byron Lane,Lex Michael,Ramiro Paré,Bruce Wagner",R,David Cronenberg,"Alfa Films,Cinecolor Films,Cinetel,Cinéart,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,Future Film,Golden Scene,Hollywood Entertainment,Le Pacte,MFA+ FilmDistribution,Presidio,Shaw Organisation,Top Film Baltic,Top Film Baltic,Top Film Baltic,Vértigo Films,Adler Entertainment,Ascot Elite Home Entertainment,Calinos Films,Cinetel,Entertainment One,Film1,Focus World,Front Row Filmed Entertainment,Future Film,Hero,IPA Asia Pacific,MFA+ FilmDistribution,NOS Audiovisuais,Top Film Distribution,Twin Pics,Viceland","Prospero Pictures,Sentient Entertainment,SBS Productions,Integral Film,Movie Central,The Movie Network,Téléfilm Canada,VIP Cinéma","Comedy,Drama,Mystery",111

116,17. Walk of Shame,2014,"A reporter's dream of becoming a news anchor is compromised after a one-night stand leaves her stranded in downtown L.A. without a phone, car, ID or money - and only 8 hours to make it to the most important job interview of her life. Meghan Miles is a TV correspondent who works at a local Tv station. She gets an opportunity to work at a network. She goes home to celebrate with her boyfriend. Her friends show up to celebrate with her. But they find her despondent. It seems like her boyfriend left without saying good bye and the network is leaning towards someone else. Her friends convince her to go out and get drunk. They get her to put on a hot dress. She eventually gets so drunk that a guy offers to take her home but she prefers to go to his place. And she spends the night. When she wakes up she gets s call telling her that the network is reconsidering her so she has to go to work but her car was towed away and her wallet which in her purse is also in it. And she left her phone at the guy's place. She then finds herself wandering around downtown LA and runs into drug dealers and people think she's a hooker. So she has to find a way get to work. And even the police are after her.—rcs0411@yahoo.com In Los Angeles, the journalist Meghan Miles is disputing the anchor position of a TV network with another candidate. Megan is a calm woman from Texas that has just broken with her boyfriend. Her friends Rose and Denise come to her house to celebrate her new job, but she learns that the other candidate has won the position. However her friends convince her to go to a night-club to drink to forget the deception and she wears a sexy yellow dress. She gets drunk and a stranger called Gordon offers to drive her home, but she prefers to go to his apartment and they have one night stand. When she wakes up, she finds a message in her cellular from a friend telling that she had been selected for the anchor position and her friend advises her to rest since her audition will be on the next day. Meghan leaves Gordon's apartment and finds that her car has been towed away with her purse. Further, the door of the building is locked and she does not know the number of the apartment where Gordon lives. So she decides to take a cab to retrieve her car, but the driver is a foreigner and misunderstands the tow place and she ends alone without money in the red zone downtown LA. Meghan sees a police car but the officers are douchebag and believe she is a prostitute. Meghan stumbles with drug dealers that try to help her but she only gets in trouble during the long night.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Straight-laced Meghan Miles is having a string of bad luck. Her live-in fiancé Kyle has just broken up with her, basically emptying out their apartment. A local Los Angeles on-air reporter turned local news anchor, she is included in a broadcast news blooper reel posted online, albeit one little seen or known. She is hoping to hide that fact when she goes in for an interview for a national network news anchor position. Despite the network not finding out about her on-air mishap, Meghan eventually learns that, although being on the short list of two, she ends up in second place. To cheer her up, Meghan's best friends Rose and Denise take her out on the town for an evening of boozing and generally whooping it up, behavior which is atypical for Meghan. That atypical behavior includes borrowing one of Denise's skin-tight short short dresses instead of wearing her regular attire of a pantsuit. The evening, which ends up including a one night stand with Gordon, a Renaissance man who was the bartender at the club, takes an uphill turn when Meghan learns that she will get the national network job if she impresses the network brass at the next local newscast a five o'clock. However, Meghan getting to the studio on time and prepared is not as easy as it should be as she, working her way from Gordon's apartment, eventually ends up without her car and money, and clad only in Denise's less than professional skin tight dress (that is unless one is talking about the oldest profession). As such, she gets into one misadventure after another with no guarantee that she will make it to the studio on time, or if she does that she will come across as she wants.—Huggo On the verge of finally getting that big promotion and the job of her dreams, the local Los Angeles newscaster and hopeful network television anchorwoman, Meghan Miles, receives a double blow on the same day, when her fiancé leaves her, and she discovers that she loses the job she wants. As a result, in a desperate attempt to drown her sorrows, Meghan will resolve to a wild girls-only night out, only to find herself in the bedroom of the cute and sensitive bartender, Gordon, in the following morning. And then, an unexpected phone-call puts Meghan back in the picture, as long as she can make it in time; however, without a phone, a car, or money, and wrapped in a snug bumblebee-yellow dress with a pair of matching stilettos, somehow, crossing L.A. on foot is easier said than done.

Inspired by reality shows and Indian cricket games on TV, Bernstein gets the bold idea of finding cricket players in India and training them to become pro baseball players in America. After a long search, Bernstein finds two talented but non-cricket-playing youths, Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel and takes them to Los Angeles where they find mastering a new sport in a foreign land a daunting challenge. As these boys struggle amid an alien culture, Bernstein must find a way to make their dream come true, during which he finds a deeper humanity to his work with unexpected and growing friendships.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) The company is in serious financial straits, and they lose the big client they've been grooming.

119,20. The Captive,2014,"Eight years after the disappearance of Cassandra, some disturbing incidents seem to indicate that she's still alive. Police, parents and Cassandra herself, will try to unravel the mystery of her disappearance. Teenager Cassandra is locked up against her will unable to contact her family to let them know she's still alive. Flashback to eight years ago when 9-year-old Cass was abducted from her father's truck and he goes straight to the authorities who immediately peg him as the prime suspect. Eight years later, her father, Matthew, is still being investigated by the police who are also trying to crack the bigger problem of crimes against children, Matthew's marriage has deteriorated and leads in the case are hard to come by. So much time but so little has changed and it's going to be up to Matthew and Cassandra herself to repair the estranged family.—Anne Campbell It's been eight years since Matthew and Tina Lane's daughter, Cassandra Lane, went missing, she ten years old at the time. The general thought is that she was abducted as opposed to she having gone off on her own volition, as she went missing when Matt made a short and regular stop at a truck stop when driving home from picking Cass up after figure skating practice, he leaving Cass in the back seat of his truck. Matt and Tina's marriage was not able to survive largely on Tina still blaming Matt for her disappearance. The situation was only exacerbated by Niagara Regional Police Detective Jeffrey Cornwall - just transferred from Homicide to work in the Internet Child Exploitation Unit headed by Nicole Dunlop - believing that Matt may have been involved in her disappearance, he possibly having sold her to help pay the bills. Not trusting the police after all these years, Matt has vowed to find Cass on his own, which only added to the strain between him and Tina, as Tina saw no comprehensive plan from him to achieve that goal, while Tina still keeps in touch with Nicole and Jeffrey, who have since entered into their own personal relationship. Jeffrey believes they've made a break in the case when he, now patrolling the dark web on child pornography sites, thinks he found a recent image of Cass. It indeed is her, she being held captive in a locked room by a man named Mika, his identity which Cass has never discovered even after all these years. He is a pedophile, and even though eighteen year old Cass no longer appeals to the pedophile in him, he is using her to lure other children into his midst. Through this time, Mika, with computer expertise, has been able to monitor specifically Tina's movements at work as a chambermaid at a Niagara Falls hotel. The question then becomes whether the police and/or Matt can infiltrate Mika's world to save Cass, or if he, using his expertise, can further evade detection as Cass' captor.—Huggo In just a few minutes, Matthew Lane's life changed forever. While buying a pie at a roadside shop in Niagara Falls, his 9-year-old daughter, Cassandra, disappeared without a trace. As the devastating reality of Cassandra's abduction sinks in, Matthew and his wife, Tina, see their marriage crumble under the weight of grief. And then, eight agonising years later, a glimmer of hope emerges--solid evidence suggests that a teenage Cassandra is alive.

Turner, an unconventional British painter, goes down memory lane and recalls his romantic relationship with a seaside landlady and the various accolades he received for his works of art. Mr. Turner explores the last quarter century of the great if eccentric British painter J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851). Profoundly affected by the death of his father, loved by a housekeeper he takes for granted and occasionally exploits sexually, he forms a close relationship with a seaside landlady with whom he eventually lives incognito in Chelsea, where he dies.

122,23. Clouds of Sils Maria,2014,"A film star comes face-to-face with an uncomfortable reflection of herself while starring in a revival of the play that launched her career. The first real professional success for famed French actress Maria Enders was twenty years ago as the co-lead in writer Wilhelm Melchoir's play and subsequent movie ""Maloja Snake"", he who picked Maria, then an unknown, personally. She played Sigrid, an opportunistic eighteen year old in an emotionally dependent lesbian relationship with forty year old Helena, who was at a vulnerable stage of her life. Maria has turned down the play's upcoming London revival in which she would now play Helena, it remounted by director Klaus Diesterweg. Her reasons for turning down the role are many including: being at a vulnerable stage of her own life going through a painful divorce; remembering the suicide of Susan Rosenberg, the original Helena, following the original run of the play, the suicide purportedly mirroring what happens to Helena; and the painful memories of the production in still having hard feelings toward who was her older male costar, Henryk Wald, with who she had an affair at the time. Maria reconsiders and accepts the role when Wilhelm unexpectedly passes away, she hearing the news en route to the Zurich Film Festival where she was to accept an award on recluse Wilhelm's behalf. Maria begins to regret her decision, largely due to having to work with nineteen year old Jo-Ann Ellis as Sigrid, Jo-Ann a trained actress whose Hollywood lifestyle is making her self-destruct, this behavior which Maria, who hates the Internet and the Hollywood gossip on it, did not know before signing the contract. But what may be most difficult for Maria is the role opening up her own professional relationship and friendship with her younger American personal assistant, Valentine, the two who are staying at Wilhelm's mountain retreat in Sils Maria in the Swiss Alps, where Maria is preparing for the play and where many of the locations were inspiration for the play's themes.—Huggo The Clouds of Sils Maria stars Juliette Binoche as Maria Enders, a celebrated actress who is traveling with her personal assistant Valentine (Kristen Stewart) to accept a Lifetime Achievement award for the playwright and director who launched her career. On the way, they learn that the celebrated artist has passed away. At the gala, a talented young director offers Maria the chance to star in a revival of the play that made her famous, this time portraying the part of the older woman that the young woman in the play seduces and destroys. Maria tentatively accepts, and as she attempts to find her way into the other character, she learns more about her new young co-star Jo-Ann (Chloë Grace Moretz), a talented but troubled teen the tabloids have made a fixture due to her tantrums and bad behavior.. At the peak of her international career, Maria Enders is asked to perform in a revival of the play that made her famous twenty years ago. But back then she played the role of Sigrid, an alluring young girl who disarms and eventually drives her boss Helena to suicide. Now she is being asked to step into the other role, that of the older Helena. She departs with her assistant to rehearse in Sils Maria; a remote region of the Alps. A young Hollywood starlet with a penchant for scandal is to take on the role of Sigrid, and Maria finds herself on the other side of the mirror, face to face with an ambiguously charming woman who is, in essence, an unsettling reflection of herself.—Cannes Film Festival At eighteen, Maria Enders was successful in theatre with MalojaSnake. She played Sigird, an ambitious girl with disorder charm who fascinated and led to suicide Helena, a mature woman. This role has changed her life. More than twenty years have passed when, at the peak of her fame, she was asked to receive in Zurich a prestigious award on behalf of Wilhelm Melchior, the author and director to which she owes her early recognition, and now lives as a recluse, in Sils Maria (Switzlerland). But the sudden death of the latter, a few hours before the ceremony, puts Maria Enders against the vertigo of time, that is of a past which she hasn't got away with. And even more when a young director in vogue asks her to play again in MalojaSnake, but this time on the other side of the story, Helena's, from the destruction of who she's built her notoriety. Caught in the turmoil of a divorce, which deprives her of any sentimental support, her only interlocutor is her assistant, Valentine, both the multi task assistant and her only friend, even if Maria and Valentine are trying to remove ambiguities of this intimate and exclusive relationship. But the real threat is called Jo-Ann Ellis, a very young Hollywood actress with a scandalous reputation and who'll play Sigrid. At once a rival and a disturbing mirror of her youth, which she will have no choice but to deal with. In order to reconcile with time, with age, with maturity, ending by learning that at all seasons of a life you must conquer freedom, independence and also the strength to be yourself, and sometimes painfully.—NoemieS7art",6.7,,"Juliette Binoche,Kristen Stewart,Chloë Grace Moretz,Lars Eidinger,Johnny Flynn,Angela Winkler,Hanns Zischler,Nora Waldstätten,Brady Corbet,Aljoscha Stadelmann,Claire Tran,Stuart Manashil,Peter Farkas,Ben Posener,Ricardia Bramley,Luise Berndt,Gilles Tschudi,Benoit Peverelli,Caroline De Maigret,Arnold Gramara,Sean McDonagh,Valery Bukreev,Katrin Schmidt,Jerry Kwarteng,Jakob Köhn,Steffen Mennekes,Wilhelm J.

123,24. Grace of Monaco,2014,"The story of former Hollywood star Grace Kelly's crisis of marriage and identity, during a political dispute between Monaco's Prince Rainier III and France's Charles De Gaulle, and a looming French invasion of Monaco in the early 1960s. 1961. Princess Grace, the former Grace Kelly, has been married to Prince Rainier of Monaco now for five years, they having two young children. Her transition from famed Oscar-winning Hollywood actress from a background as the daughter of a wealthy millionaire owner of a brickworks in Philadelphia to European princess of a small, exclusive and tight-knit principality has been a difficult one, the Monagasques who have been less than welcoming to her in her outspoken American nature. Even in her official charity work as head of a women's committee for the Red Cross, the other committee members largely grumble under their breath about her as their leader. Despite loving Rainier, their marriage is a largely distant one emotionally as he focuses on his role as monarch, now an especially difficult time in the on-going tension between Monaco and France under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle, who would, if he could, annex Monaco back under French control. She has a small entourage of trusted advisers who lead her through the maze of her life, including an American Catholic priest, Father Francis Tucker, currently based in Monaco, and she bringing back into the fold Rupert Allan, who worked as her Hollywood publicist. Despite the unofficial roles of the members of this entourage, Grace has never had official guidance into all that it means to be Princess of Monaco. She has always been courted by the Hollywood community to continue acting, the thoughts of doing so stronger now than ever in her general unhappiness, with a concrete high profile role offered to her by her oft late career collaborator Sir Alfred Hitchcock. She returning to acting would be seen by the Monagasques and probably Rainier as she turning her back on her royal duties. What Grace decides to do under the circumstances takes into account her own happiness, the welfare of their two children who nonetheless will inherit the throne, whether she loves Rainier enough especially in light of an action by France, and whether she sees herself as Princess, and what she can do for the monarchy, the principality, and its subjects in light of her relationship with Rainier.—Huggo",5.7,"$30,000,000 (estimated)","Nicole Kidman,Tim Roth,Frank Langella,Paz Vega,Parker Posey,Milo Ventimiglia,Geraldine Somerville,Nicholas Farrell,Robert Lindsay,Derek Jacobi,André Penvern,Jeanne Balibar,Flora Nicholson,Yves Jacques,Olivier Rabourdin,Roger Ashton-Griffiths,Jean Dell,Philip Delancy,Ron Webster,Catherine Schaub-Abkarian,Serpentine Teyssier,Bruce MacEwen,Satya Dusaugey,Elizabeth Counsell,Jérémie Covillault,Peter Burley,Nicholas Hawtrey,Alexandre Pottier,Colette Kraffe,Valérie Zaccomer,Candela Cottis,Andréa Ceretti,Roméo Mestanza,Maria Chiara de Bourbon des Deux Siciles,Maria Carolina de Bourbon des Deux Siciles,Fabien Baïardi,Mas Belsito,Samuel Brafman-Moutier,Guillaume Briat,Philippe Briouse,Alban Casterman,Christian Kiappe,David Coburn,Stéphanie Colpé,Pascaline Crêvecoeur,Nathalie Dahan,Sébastien Dupuis,Lionel Erdogan,Aubert Fenoy,Edwin Flay,Mathias Honoré,Laurent Jumeaucourt,Sarah Li,Ian McCamy,Gabriella Meroni,Robbie Nock,Ariane Séguillon,Mathilde Snodgrass,Csilla Szabò,Sebastian Badarau,Tim Baker,Guillaume Gascoin,Lorenzo Harani,Magdalena Korpas,Esteban Perroy,Zelda Rittner,Grégoire Thoby,Jean Vincentelli,Rupert Wynne-James",Not,Olivier Dahan,"United Entertainment Partners,Captive Cinema Distribution,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,Finnkino,Gaga,Gaumont,Golden Scene,Golden Village Pictures,Huaxia Film Distribution,Lucky Red,PlayArte Pictures,Pro Video Film & Distribution Kft.,Scanbox Entertainment,Scanbox Norge,Seven Films,Seven Stars Entertainment,SquareOne Entertainment,The Weinstein Company,Warner Bros.,Ascot Elite Entertainment Group,Audio Visual Entertainment,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,Film1,KVH Media Group,Lifetime,Lucky Red,Rai 1,TriPictures,Universum Film (UFA),Universum Film (UFA),Warner Home Video,Warner Home Video,Yash Raj Films,Zon Audiovisuais","Stone Angels,YRF Entertainment,Umedia,Lucky Red,TF1 Films Production,Canal+,Gaumont,Od Shots,Philophon,Silver Reel,uFilm","Biography,Drama,Romance",103

Following the death of their only offspring, an infant son named Cody, married New Yorkers Conor Ludlow and Eleanor Rigby - a struggling restaurateur and an academic working on her Ph.D. in Anthropology before Cody arrived in their lives - hit a rough spot in their relationship. Although still loving Conor, El is uncertain if she can bear what Conor represents to her and bear the grief even if Conor is no longer in her life. Following an incident, El decides to disappear from Conor's life, she taking refuge at the suburban home of her parents Julian and Mary Rigby, an academic himself and a musician respectively. Just to keep her mind active and off the thought of Conor or Cody, Julian suggests to El that she return to college and he pulls some strings for El possibly to enter into his colleague Professor Lilian Friedman's class. Despite being a therapist himself, he also tries to get El to see a therapist to deal with her grief. Meanwhile, Conor is facing his own emotional and professional problems, he believing his life being clear when he was with El. The restaurant was in part following his father Spencer Ludlow's professional footsteps, although Conor does not like to believe he is anything like his father in temperament, he who is on his third marriage, each of the previous two which failed. As Conor tries to locate El, he also has to deal with the downward slide of the restaurant, which he opened in another part as a cooperative arrangement with classically trained chef Stuart, a longtime friend who nonetheless doesn't treat cooking with much seriousness. Conor also has to deal with the logistics of packing up his and El's apartment which includes what to do with Cody's belongings. In his loneliness, Conor may fall prey to other women despite still loving El himself.

A growing nation of genetically evolved apes led by Caesar is threatened by a band of human survivors of the devastating virus unleashed a decade earlier. They reach a fragile peace, but it proves short-lived, as both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species.—Twentieth Century Fox Some years after his escape from captivity Caesar heads a vast colony of apes and chimps living a self-sufficient life in the woods outside San Francisco. In the city itself a depleted group of Simian Flu survivors struggle to exist, their best hope being to revitalise a hydro-electric dam which will restore their power. However to reach it they must pass through Caesar's domain. Group leader Malcolm and Caesar have a mutual respect which allows the restoration to take place but Caesar's embittered lieutenant Koba, a victim of animal experimentation, has no such faith in humans and usurps Caesar, leading a full-scale attack on the city, most of whose inhabitants regard the apes as savages and a fierce battle takes place.

New York police officer Ralph Sarchie (Eric Bana), struggling with his own personal issues, begins investigating a series of disturbing and inexplicable crimes.

Based upon the book, which details Sarchie's bone-chilling real-life cases.—Sony Pictures Entertainment In New York, Police Officer Ralph Sarchie and his partner Butler investigate a series of bizarre crimes in Bronx: the death of a baby in an alley: the beating of the wife of the former soldier Jimmy by him; and the case of a mother, Jane Crenna, who has thrown her two year old son in the enclosure of the lions in the zoo. While investigating the last case with Butler, Sarchie sees a weird man painting the wall of the lion's enclosure but he flees.

131,7. Jersey Boys,2014,"The story of four young men from the wrong side of the tracks in New Jersey who came together to form the iconic 1960s rock group The Four Seasons. This movie is a musical biography of the Four Seasons, the rise, the tough times and personal clashes, and the ultimate triumph of a group of friends whose music became symbolic of a generation. Far from a mere tribute concert (though it does include numbers from the popular Four Seasons songbook), this movie gets to the heart of the relationships at the center of the group, with a special focus on frontman Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young), the small kid with the big falsetto. In addition to following the quartet's coming-of-age as performers, the core of this movie is how an allegiance to a code of honor learned in the streets of their native New Jersey got them through a multitude of challenges: gambling debts, Mafia threats, and family disasters. This movie is a glimpse at the people behind a sound that has managed to endure for over four decades in the hearts of the public.—Broadway.com The rise and fall of the original formation of The Four Seasons, comprised of Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza), Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda), Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young), and Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen), is presented. Their story as a collective begins in 1951 in a crime-ridden neighborhood in Belleville, New Jersey. For boys, in general, to get out of the neighborhood, they either have to join the Army, get mobbed up, or become famous. Tommy and Nick try options two and three, they, who perform in a combo with Tommy's brother Nick (Johnny Cannizzaro) when they aren't committing petty crimes, into which they began to pull impressionable sixteen-year-old Frankie. Frankie, with his distinctive tenor voice which places him in the good books and heart of local mobster Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo (Christopher Walken), already dreamt of stardom, which didn't seem to be happening. Tommy decides to let Frankie front the band for their mutual benefit. With Nicky no longer involved, Tommy, the de facto group manager, knows they need a fourth to move to the next level. That fourth ends up being songwriter Bob, who, against Tommy's wishes, would only collaborate with the group as a full partner, as opposed to a paid contractor as Tommy wants, he not wanting the addition of a keyboardist within their pure guitar sound. Bob's primary want to join the group is to write songs specifically to showcase Frankie's voice. But even to reach the top forty, they learn they need money to make money, which Tommy gets the way he always does without really thinking through the consequences. Beyond those money issues eventually coming back to bite them after they achieve fame and wealth, their differences as people and bandmates will lead to their demise as a foursome. Tommy, the A-personality, didn't want to cede control as the fame led to an even greater sense of entitlement. Nick always threatened to form his own band when things were going badly, deep in his heart knowing that Frankie, and to a lesser extent, Bob, were the stars. Despite the fame, Frankie could never shake being from the old neighborhood and what that meant, especially in relation to Tommy and Gyp. And Bob, the straight-laced one, only really had his and Frankie's backs, which fundamentally was against Tommy's control.—Huggo The story opens in New Jersey, where young Francesco Castelluccio (John Lloyd Young) and his buddies face a narrow window of future career options. Their possible paths include show business on one hand and organized crime on the other, embodied by the slightly menacing yet avuncular kingpin, Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo (Christopher Walken), who runs the neighborhood and keeps an eye on them. The boys begin to nurture dreams of becoming musical stars, goals that seem far out of reach until they invite Francesco to perform with them in their band, then rename him ""Frankie Valli"". His unique falsetto vocals captivate the girls in the audience, which provides a sign of things to come. The young hopefuls sign a contract at the Brill Building and begin doing back-up vocals for Record Producer Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle), but experience frustration when Crewe drags his feet on recording them as a solo act. Later, the performers name themselves The Four Seasons after feeling inspired by an unusual source. They add songwriter-musician Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) and the equation is complete. Crewe hears Gaudio's composition ""Sherry"", decides to double-track Valli's voice, and helps create a national sensation. Later, however, certain difficulties begin to take their toll on the band, including financial problems, inner rivalries and tensions between the bandmates, and Valli's long periods on the road away from his wife and daughters.

133,9. The Rewrite,2014,"An Oscar-winning writer in a slump leaves Hollywood to teach screenwriting at a college on the East Coast, where he falls for a single mom taking classes there. Keith Michaels, an academy award winner for his screenplay for the movie ""Paradise Misplaced"", now faces the challenge of being rejected in Hollywood. To get a breakthrough he is forced to take the job he most hates, teaching. The assignment is at a college is far from his comforts and could possibly take him to a new life.—Thejus Joseph Jose Resting on his laurels for a 1999 smash hit melodrama entitled ""Paradise Misplaced"", the Oscar-winning screenwriter for best screenplay and Hollywood's one-hit-wonder, Keith Michaels, is forced to leave the sun-kissed L.A. to teach a screenwriting course at the rainy Binghamton in New York. Once there, right from the start, the once-acclaimed writer will attract the attention of the head of the college ethics committee, the stern Ms Weldon, while in the meantime in a class filled with eye candy, Holly, the hard-working single mother and hopeful writer, seems to see right through him. In the end, can Keith, the unrepentantly egocentric big fish out of the water, find a true connection between himself and the small community?—Nick Riganas Keith Michaels wrote the screenplay for ""Paradise Misplaced"" for which he won a Best Original Screenplay Oscar fifteen years ago, the movie which is beloved by most who have seen it. But he may only have three salable screenplays in him - the other two movies which were abject failures both critically and commercially - as his pitches to movie executives now fall flat and his agent Ellen is unable to find him any screenwriting work. In addition, his personal life is failing, as he has long divorced and has not spoken to his eighteen year old son Alex in over a year, Alex who was his inspiration for ""Paradise"". The only job Ellen is able to secure for him is the writer in residence at Binghamton University in upstate New York, he who would be required to teach an undergraduate screenwriting course. With his resources dwindling, he has no other option but to accept the job, despite he believing that writing in general is an unteachable skill and believing the old adage that those who cannot do, teach. It is also hate at first sight with Binghamton which he sees as a perpetually cold and rainy provincial backwater compared to Hollywood. He has a mixed bag relationship with his fellow professors in the English Department. While the department head, Hal Lerner, a strict military guy with a soft spot, truly likes Keith, Keith immediately butts heads with feminist Jane Austen expert Mary Weldon, also chair of the ethics committee, who sees in Keith a misogynist pop culture hack who has no credentials to teach at the university level. She may be correct especially with the misogyny in the way Keith secretly chooses the majority of the ten students to take his class, the decision having nothing to do with their thirty page screenplay submissions on which they were to be evaluated. Although Keith has no intention to teach at all as he thinks of ways to get back to Hollywood and be an ""it"" player in the business, he eventually discovers that he has something to pass along to the students, they in turn who may provide him with another view of life. He especially makes a connection with mature student, Holly Carpenter, a single mother who has to work several jobs to make ends meet. But what Keith discovers as his desired life may be threatened if his misogyny on campus - namely an inappropriate relationship with student, Karen Gabney, which he initially didn't understand from his Hollywood mentality was inappropriate - is discovered, especially by Dr. Weldon.—Huggo",6.3,N/A,"Hugh Grant,Whit Baldwin,Vanessa Wasche,Enid Graham,Shannon Marie Sullivan,Jason Antoon,Jenny Neale,Caroline Aaron,Billy Griffith,Kevin Michael Kennedy,Ali Merhi,Bella Heathcote,Lily Wen,Olivia Luccardi,Chris Elliott,John Deyle,J.K.

Stonehearst Asylum,2014,"An Oxford graduate takes up a job in a mental asylum, only to discover that the ""revolutionary"" new treatments are inhumane, and that there is more going on than meets the eye. A couple of days before 1899 Christmas, the Oxford new graduate Dr. Edward Newgate arrives at the Stonehearst Asylum to complete training for his specialty of asylum medicine. He is met by armed men who take him to Dr. Silas Lamb, who welcomes his help and takes him under his wing. Edward is shocked to see the methods that Dr. Lamb uses to run this asylum. He becomes infatuated with Eliza Graves, one of the patients who is a lady of status and does not seem to belong. One night, Edward overhears a knocking from the bowels of the facility and is shocked to find that everything is not as it seems in this place and that his uneasy feelings may be justified.

Hercules,2014,"Having endured his legendary twelve labors, Hercules, the Greek demigod, has his life as a sword-for-hire tested when the King of Thrace and his daughter seek his aid in defeating a tyrannical warlord. 1400 B.C., a tormented soul walked the Earth that was neither man nor god. Hercules (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) was the powerful son of the god King Zeus. For this, he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labors, and the death of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years, he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting, and the presence of death. These men and women never question where they go to fight, or why, or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now, the King of Thrace, Lord Cotys (Sir John Hurt) has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen, when they must train an army to become as ruthless and bloodthirsty as their reputation has become.—ahmetkozan Hercules' (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's) cousin bard Iolaus (Reese Ritchie) and seer Amphiaraus (Ian McShane) tell the grim story they lived, as companions with trauma-dumb great warrior Tydeus (Aksel Hennie) and Amazon Queen Atalanta (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal), of Zeus' bastard son Hercules, hated by his cheated non-mother Hera, but focus on the unknown part after his glorious twelve works, which prove to be greatly ""embellished"", as monsters weren't really supernatural. They wandered around Greece as mercenary troubleshooters with a residual conscience, despite veteran cynicism. Lord Cotys (Sir John Hurt), the ruler of the outward Greek kingdom of Thrace, gets his daughter Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson) and her irresistible pre-teen son Arius (Isaac Andrews), the legitimate heir, to enlist Hercules' band to reunite the country under Cotys by defeating the forces of his brother Rhesus (Tobias Santelmann).

156,9. Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces,2014,"Twin Peaks before Twin Peaks (1990) and at the same time not always and entirely in the same place as Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992). A feature film which presents deleted scenes from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) assembled together for the first time in an untold portion of the story's prequel. Assembled from the deleted and extended scenes of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, and showing the untold portion of the FBI's investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks, as well as expanding on the last seven days of Laura Palmer's life, Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces becomes an integral part of the deeper mysteries surrounding the Twin Peaks series.—Relical Piecing together deleted and extended scenes from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992), ""The Missing Pieces"" is a collection of vitally crucial new ideas and details that have been edited together into roughly an hour-and-half compilation of uninterrupted transitions and strange cul-de-sacs. Approaching a more linear narrative, even though these elusive scenes don't seem to offer much to the story, they contribute to the overall feel of the film, providing context and information on notoriously inscrutable characters, such as Special Agent Phillip Jeffries, or revealing insight into the events before the murder of Teresa Banks. In the end, the incomplete Missing Pieces film is all about the little hidden details; a real treat for the die-hard fans of Twin Peaks (1990) and Twin Peaks (2017).—Nick Riganas",7.5,N/A,"Chris Isaak,Kiefer Sutherland,C.H.

160,13. Magic in the Moonlight,2014,"A romantic comedy about an Englishman brought in to help unmask a possible swindle. Personal and professional complications ensue. Wei Ling Soo, a.k.a. Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth) is a magician who has dedicated his life to revealing fraudulent spiritualists. He plans to quickly uncover the truth behind celebrated spiritualist Sophie Baker (Emma Stone) and her scheming mother (Marcia Gay Harden). However, the more time he spends with her, he starts thinking that she might actually be able to communicate with the other world, but even worse, he might be falling in love with her.—Anne Campbell In 1928, smalltime magician Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney) seeks out the successful magician Wei Ling Soo, a.k.a. Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth), in Berlin, Germany. They have been friends since childhood and Howard invites Stanley to travel to the south of France to expose American clairvoyant Sophie Baker (Emma Stone), who has convinced the matriarch of the wealthy Catledge family and her son Brice Catledge (Hamish Linklater) that she is legitimate. Brice has proposed to her to get married. Englishman Stanley is an arrogant, rational, and bitter man, and he leaves his fiancée Olivia (Catherine McCormack) in England and travels to France to visit his Aunt Vanessa (Dame Eileen Atkins) and to meet Sophie and disclose her swindle. When Stanley meets Sophie, he is spellbound by her smile and big eyes. Stanley also learns that Sophie comes from a very poor family and now has the chance to marry a millionaire. He uses Howard to help him to find her trick, but soon he is convinced that Sophie is a real medium, shaking up his principles of rationality and belief. Further, he falls in love with her. He decides to call a press conference to tell the truth about her. But what is the truth?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1928. Famed Chinese magician Wei Ling Soo, arguably the most admired man in his profession, is on a successful European tour. What the public does not know is that underneath his make-up and Chinoiserie, he is really Caucasian Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth) of England. Stanley is a man of science, he believing that everything, like his illusions, can be explained logically. As such, he is an avowed atheist. Because of his non-belief of concepts such as faith, he is also a largely emotionless man. Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney), Stanley's childhood friend and a magician in his own right, asks him for a favor: help him expose a young American woman named Sophie Baker (Emma Stone) acting as a psychic and medium. Sophie and her mother (Marcia Gay Harden), who are from a poor background, have infiltrated the wealthy Catledge family of the French Riviera. The Bakers have been able to bilk money from the Catledges in their belief in what Sophie has told them. While the Catledge daughter Caroline (Erica Leerhsen) and her husband George (Jeremy Shamos) believe Sophie is a fake, the Catledge son Brice (Hamish Linklater) and the family matriarch Grace (Jackie Weaver) want to bring Sophie into their lives permanently, Grace, who wants to set up a foundation for Sophie, and Brice who wants to marry her. In observing Sophie's abilities, Howard, a skeptic, admits that he was unable to explain how Sophie was able to do the things that happened, such as making certain items levitate, and that she knew things that there is no way she could have known. Stanley is glad to oblige Howard's request, he often exposes mediums in his steadfast belief that there is no such thing as psychic ability. Stanley hopes to visit with his Aunt Vanessa (Dame Eileen Atkins), the woman who largely raised him, while he is doing this work for Howard. She lives in Provence and is arguably his favorite person in the world. In Stanley and Sophie meeting at the Catledge home, Sophie knows, based on his outward disdain toward her, that he is there to question her abilities. Stanley, conversely, admits to himself that time after time he cannot explain how Sophie does or knows what she does or knows. Regardless, he largely holds steadfast to his belief about her. But as Stanley spends more time with Aunt Vanessa and Sophie, he may come to a realization that a little unexplained phenomenon may actually make him a happier man.—Huggo",6.5,"$16,800,000 (estimated)","Colin Firth,Antonia Clarke,Natasha Andrews,Valérie Beaulieu,Peter Wollasch,Jürgen Zwingel,Wolfgang Pissors,Sébastien Siroux,Simon McBurney,Ute Lemper,Catherine McCormack,Eileen Atkins,Erica Leerhsen,Jeremy Shamos,Hamish Linklater,Didier Muller,Emma Stone,Marcia Gay Harden,Jacki Weaver,Ronald Alphonse,Ronald Baker,Kelly Keto,Olivier Marchevet,Georges-Edouard Nouel,Mark Sims,Rudolf Krause,Patrick Zard,Pedro Chomnalez,Jessica Forde,Paul Bandey,Lionel Abelanski,Baby Bauer,Pascal Duthuin,Kenneth Edelson,Mark Kubr,Lana Lienard,Jean Vincentelli",PG-13,Woody Allen,"Sony Pictures Classics,KVH Media Group,Mars Distribution,Mongrel Media,Energía Entusiasta,Filmware International,Frenetic Films,Golden Scene,Hollywood Classic Entertainment,Odeon,Paradiso Entertainment,Pro Video Film & Distribution Kft.,Shaw Organisation,Warner Bros.,Warner Bros.,Warner Bros.,Dreamwest Pictures,Hollydan Works,Imagem Filmes,Pinema,Pris Audiovisuais,Scanbox Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Longride,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Warner Home Video,Warner Home Video,Film1,Odeon,Paradiso Home Entertainment,Warner Home Video,Warner Home Video,Transeuropa Video Entertainment (TVE),Finnkino,Hero,Liv,Nelonen,Yleisradio (YLE)","Gravier Productions,Dippermouth,Perdido Productions,Ske-Dat-De-Dat Productions,Cinéfrance 1888","Comedy,Drama,Romance",97

When he awakes, he has amnesia and tries to recall his last steps from the Kadie's saloon on the Saturday night. He recalls that he found four playboys burning a homeless man alive and defended the poor man. Marv hunts them down and kills the group.

Also new to the series is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Johnny, a mysterious gambler set on taking down his sworn enemy in a high-stakes game of life and death.. Bridging the gap between the past and the future of Sin City (2005)'s doomed anti-heroes, Frank Miller's story revolves around the second volume in the comic-book series, A Dame to Kill For. With no recollection of how he ended up encircled by dead bodies in The Projects, his old neighbourhood on the run-down side of the town, Marv, the violent mountain of muscles, tries to connect the dots. Drawn by the city's grim allure, newcomer Johnny, an overconfident card shark, finds his way to Kadie's Saloon and brazenly takes part in a high-stakes poker game with the city's absolute ruler, Senator Roark. Elsewhere, the tough private eye, Dwight McCarthy, still sporting his old face, becomes enmeshed in a deadly scheme when his seductive old flame and professional femme fatale, Ava Lord, re-enters his life.

But, is there justice without sin?—Nick Riganas Same town, same people, different stories.

173,2. 99 Homes,2014,"A recently unemployed single father struggles to get back his foreclosed home by working for the real estate broker who is the source of his frustration. Around the world everyone knows that honest hard work gets you nowhere. In sunny Orlando, Florida, construction worker Dennis Nash learns this the hard way when he is evicted from his home by a charismatic, gun-toting real-estate broker, Rick Carver. Humiliated and homeless, Nash has no choice but to move his mom and nine-year old son into a shabby, dangerous motel. All is lost. Until an unexpected opportunity arises for Nash to strike a deal with the devil - he begins working for Carver in a desperate attempt to get his home back. Carver seduces Nash into a risky world of scamming and stealing from the banks and the government; he teaches Nash how the rich get richer. Living a double life, Nash hides his new boss and job from his family. He rises fast and makes real money; he dreams bigger. But there is a cost. On Carver's orders, Nash must evict honest families from their homes - just as it happened to him. Nash's conscience starts tearing him apart... but his son needs a home. In a dramatic high stakes climax, with a 1,000 home deal on the line, Nash will have to choose between destroying an honest man for the ultimate win or risking it all by going against Carver and finding redemption. Hard-working single father Dennis Nash and his mother are evicted from their home. Desperate to get his house back, Nash goes to work for the wealthy and ruthless businessman Rick Carver - the very man who repossessed Nash's home. It is a deal-with-the-devil that comes with an increasingly high cost - on Carver's orders, Nash must evict families from their homes; in return, Nash is promised a lifestyle of wealth and glamour. Handy single father Dennis Nash always worked off his tail in construction in sunny Orlando, Florida, to provide for his equally doting son Connor and in-living mother, but gets laid off as the firm is bankrupted by the crisis. Unable to pay off his mortgage, he gets evicted by the bank's regular cahoot, charismatic, gun-toting real-estate broker, Rick Carver, who gets rich from such evictions. Seeing honest Dennis volunteering for a dirty job, he hires him regularly, for better-paid but less innocent jobs, trying to make inevitable evictions less hard for fellow victims. Dennis agrees only to buy back his home, but gets drawn in ever further, tasting the luxurious lifestyle, yet unable to turn off his conscience. Tempted to 'settle for ' a grander villa, he's deserted by his family and hesitates whether to side with lucrative crook Carver or fellow evicted honest workers like himself.—KGF Vissers It is a gripping drama set against the backdrop of the Great Recession in Florida. The film follows Dennis Nash, a single father played by Andrew Garfield, who is evicted from his home by a ruthless real estate broker, Rick Carver, portrayed by Michael Shannon. In a desperate bid to reclaim his family's home, Nash makes a deal with Carver to work for him, even if it means evicting other homeowners.—ajintvarghese1",7.1,"$8,000,000 (estimated)","Michael Shannon,Douglas M.

174,3. The Imitation Game,2014,"During World War II, the English mathematical genius Alan Turing tries to crack the German Enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians while attempting to come to terms with his troubled private life. It is based on the real life story of legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing. The film portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his brilliant team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II.—Studio Canal Out in the world, one who is compelled to create is considered abnormal. Society is hard on the non-conformist. A creator may solve impossible puzzles with his brain or write symphony; he turns nothing into something. Success in his endeavor may result in the masses of society clustering at the median to call him ""genius."" But, beware: this means they can neither understand the achievement nor hope to equal the mind who made it. The same masses who eagerly accept his gifts with the one hand will turn around and push him into a snake pit with the other. Such is the cautionary tale of Alan Mathison Turing, master of the puzzle and father of the modern computer.—LA-Lawyer In 1939, newly created British intelligence agency MI6 recruits Cambridge mathematics alumnus Alan Turing to crack Nazi codes, including Enigma -- which cryptanalysts had thought unbreakable. Turing's team, including Joan Clarke, analyze Enigma messages while he builds a machine to decipher them. Turing and team finally succeed and become unsung heroes, but in 1952, their quiet genius leader encounters disgrace—Jwelch5742 With Europe succumbing to Adolf Hitler's suffocating grasp, the British government recruits the country's best scientists to stop the Nazis. However, the Allies are running out of time. Now, only a radical, out-of-the-box approach could save millions of lives. As a result, Alan Turing joins a hand-picked team of accomplished code breakers at Bletchley Park, determined to crack the code behind the infamous Enigma Machine, the Germans' top-secret, military-grade encipherment device. But to turn the tide of the war, Alan and his fellow cryptanalysts have their work cut out for them: they must first figure out a reliable technique for cracking the Enigma's millions of combinations.—Nick Riganas",8.0,"$14,000,000 (estimated)","Benedict Cumberbatch,Keira Knightley,Matthew Goode,Rory Kinnear,Allen Leech,Matthew Beard,Charles Dance,Mark Strong,James Northcote,Tom Goodman-Hill,Steven Waddington,Ilan Goodman,Jack Tarlton,Alex Lawther,Jack Bannon,Tuppence Middleton,Dominic Charman,James G.

176,5. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),2014,"A washed-up superhero actor attempts to revive his fading career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway production. Actor Riggan Thomson is most famous for his movie role from over twenty years ago of the comic book superhero Birdman in the blockbuster movie of the same name and its two equally popular sequels. His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than ""Riggan Thomson"" the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name, what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project, and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night, Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name, Mike Shiner, for that role, Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter, Sam, who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson, who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggan's biggest problem may be his own insecurities, which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character, who he often battles both internally and externally.—Huggo Former cinema superhero Riggan Thomson is mounting an ambitious Broadway production that he hopes will breathe new life into his stagnant career. It's risky, but he hopes that his creative gamble will prove that he's a real artist and not just a washed-up movie star. As opening night approaches, a cast mate is injured, forcing Riggan to hire an actor who is guaranteed to shake things up. Meanwhile, Riggan must deal with his girlfriend, daughter and ex-wife.—Jwelch5742 Decades ago, former Hollywood actor Riggan Thomson tasted fame as the blockbuster superhero Birdman. Nowadays, the washed-up star wants to reinvent his career and leave his mark on cinema history. To bounce back, Riggan attempts to write, direct, and star in his debut Broadway production: an ambitious adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. Determined to make it work, Riggan gives his all to overcome obstacle after obstacle, including pretentious co-stars, malicious critics, and the exhausting effect of turbulent family drama.

178,7. The Giver,2014,"In a seemingly perfect community without war, pain, suffering, differences or choices, a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man, the true pain and pleasure of the real world. A youth named Jonas lives in an equalized, colorless, but pleasant society with no knowledge of love or pain. When he and his best friends Asher and Fiona come of age, they receive their societal roles, with Jonas given the rare position of Receiver (of Memories). Because of this, he meets a mentoring elder Receiver (later called The Giver). They look at memories of the past world, of joy, pain, and love. As Jonas receives these memories, he breaks the cardinal rule against sharing them with others, thereby getting in trouble with the watchful Chief Elder. When Jonas discovers that an infant boy named Gabriel will be terminated, his efforts to save the child put him squarely against his society. Deciding that all must re-learn to see color, feel pain, and show and receive love, Jonas becomes public enemy number one. A young man living in a future where complacency is valued above all else discovers the sinister secrets that hold his fragile society together after being selected to become the Receiver of Memory in this adaptation of author Lois Lowry's Newbery Medal-winning young-adult novel. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) was raised to believe that conformity is the key to contentment. The society Jonas lives in is a peaceful one, in large part because their collective memories have been entrusted to the Giver (Jeff Bridges). A mysterious yet seemingly benevolent figure, the Giver is the sole guardian of the community's dark and hidden history. When that history is revealed to Jonas over the course of his illuminating sessions with the Giver, the young man learns that the wisdom he now holds could dictate the fate of the entire society. Later, as the weight of that responsibility becomes too great a burden for Jonas to bear, he realizes that his only hope of saving the ones he loves most is to flee. Unfortunately for Jonas and perhaps his entire world, every previous attempt to escape has ended in failure. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) was raised to believe that conformity is the key to contentment.

180,9. Wild,2014,"A chronicle of one woman's 1,100-mile solo hike undertaken as a way to recover from a recent personal tragedy. With the dissolution of her marriage and the death of her mother, Cheryl Strayed has lost all hope. After years of reckless, destructive behavior, she makes a rash decision. With absolutely no experience, driven only by sheer determination, Cheryl hikes more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, alone. Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddens, strengthen, and ultimately heals her.—Fox Searchlight 1995. Cheryl Strayed - the surname to which she had recently legally changed, and chosen specifically to reflect her life at the time - has just left her Minnesota home to hike solo the over one thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, south to north, despite having no hiking experience, that inexperience which shows along the way. If she is able to complete the hike, it should take her approximately three months. She is doing so in an effort to find herself, her life which started to take a downward spiral following the premature death of her loving mother, Bobbi Grey, four years earlier. Bobbi long ago left her abusive husband, Cheryl and her younger brother Leif's father, struggling to eke out of life for the three of them, but always living their lives with love and support. Bobbi's death led to Cheryl trying to cope with the emotional pain by drug use - specifically heroin - and indiscriminate sex, which in turn led to the break up of her marriage. Paul, her now ex-husband, is still her biggest source of human support, along with her best friend, Aimee, who plans to send her additional provisions at various points along the trail. Beyond battling the elements, the physical pain and some unexpected other threats, Cheryl still has to emerge from the other side metaphorically to find something that will get her back on track in life.—Huggo Cheryl was just 22 years old when her mother Bobbi (Laura Dern) died of cancer in 1991. As children, Cheryl and her brother watched their mother endure intense suffering at the hands of their mentally and physically abusive father, and Bobbi was just getting her life together when she fell gravely ill. The loss was too much for Cheryl to take, and before long she sank so deeply into heroin addiction that it destroyed her marriage. Four years later, Cheryl has hit rock bottom. She knows that unless she makes a change, the future she had once hoped for will slip permanently out of reach. Later, as Cheryl begins her arduous journey through the wilderness, those painful memories come flooding back as she encounters numerous dangers and disheartening setbacks. However, the kindness of strangers helps her summon the courage and endurance she'll need to stay the path.. Left with nothing, and while still grappling with addiction, the grief-stricken twentysomething, Cheryl Strayed, plucks up the courage to embark on a cathartic journey of self-enlightenment. Having no prior experience, and with the bare-minimum equipment, Cheryl decides to begin the arduous, life-altering 1,000-mile hike along the Pacific Crest Trail, utterly unprepared for the physical and mental hardships that lie ahead. Now, a woman alone before the rugged beauty of the untamed wilderness attempts to go above and beyond her limits, conquering the solitary trek to freedom one step at a time.

181,10. The Hundred-Foot Journey,2014,"The Kadam family leaves India for France where they open a restaurant directly across the road from Madame Mallory's Michelin-starred eatery. The family of talented cook, Hassan Kadam (Manish Dayal), has a life filled with both culinary delights and profound loss. Drifting through Europe after fleeing political violence in India that killed the family restaurant business and their mother, the Kadams arrive in France. Once there, a chance auto accident and the kindness of a young woman, Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), in the village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val inspires Papa Kadam (Om Puri) to set up a Indian restaurant there. Unfortunately, this puts the Kadams in direct competition with the snobbish Madame Mallory's acclaimed haute cuisine establishment across the street where Marguerite also works as a sous-chef. The resulting rivalry eventually escalates in personal intensity until it goes too far. In response, there is a bridging of sides initiated by Hassan, Marguerite, and Madame Mallory (Dame Helen Mirren), both professional and personal, that encourages an understanding that will change both sides forever.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) The Kadam family after leaving India due to a fatal tragedy finally settle in a small town in southern France. They set up a traditional family run Indian restaurant just like they had always planned but opposite a competitive French restaurant. This initial rivalry creates unexpected twists for the better and for the worse in the lives of both the Kadam family and Madame Mallory (Dame Helen Mirren), the owner of the Michelin star restaurant a hundred feet away.—Viir khubchandani Hassan Kadam (Manish Dayal), the oldest of five siblings, was taught how to cook, but more importantly truly taste and love food, by his mother. Their entire family works together in their open air eatery in Mumbai. In his role, Hassan considers himself a cook and not a chef as he was never professionally trained. Following the tragic death of Hassan's mother, his well-off but frugal Papa Kadam (Om Puri) decides to pack up the family and move to Europe to open a restaurant, the business to keep to his wife's memory in their love of South Asian cuisine. After an initial business misstep in London, Papa believes it is fate that their van breaks down just outside of the French town of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val, that they meet a local foodie, a young woman named Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), who introduces them to the abundance of fresh locally sourced produce, seafood and meats, and that there is an abandoned restaurant property on the outskirts of town for sale. Against the wishes of the family, Papa decides to purchase the property for their business, even after learning that the previous owners could not make a go of it because it is a mere one hundred feet from Le Saule Pleureur, a Michelin-starred restaurant where Marguerite works as a sous-chef, she trying to work her way up to chef-de-cuisine. Papa's resolve is strengthened as he believes their style of food is not only different than the French, but better in their bold flavors, something he wants to show the locals. Madame Mallory (Dame Helen Mirren), Le Saule Pleureur's proprietress, took over its running following the death of her husband. The restaurant is now her entire life, and she has waited close to thirty years for it to receive its second Michelin-star, so far without success. Madame Mallory does not take too kindly to her new neighbors, not only as potential competition, but in the Kadams', most specifically Papa's, brash and forward approach to life, unlike the refined French. An initial action by Madame Mallory to make sure Maison Mumbai, the Kadams' restaurant, doesn't succeed, leads to an all out war between her and Papa. But a potential bridge emerges between the two restaurants with the budding friendship and possible romance between Hassan and Marguerite. Beyond that friendship and romance, Hassan believes, to survive, they have to meld their bold flavors to local ingredients and techniques, he who wants to learn the art of French cooking from Marguerite. A singular action in that war results in what could be a fundamental shift between all the players at Le Saule Pleureur and Maison Mumbai.—Huggo Put young Hassan Kadam (Manish Dayal) in a kitchen, and he's bound to emerge with a dish that will dazzle. When Hassan's family is forced to move from their native India, his Papa (Om Puri) relocates to a peaceful hamlet in Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in the south of France. Determined to give his new neighbors a little taste of home, Papa decides to open an Indian restaurant in the village, and names it ""Maison Mumbai"". Meanwhile, across the street at the traditional French restaurant Le Saule Pleureu, uptight proprietor Madame Mallory (Dame Helen Mirren) doesn't exactly welcome the competition. When Madame Mallory ignites a bitter feud that quickly escalates, the only hope for a peaceful resolution lies in Hassan's talent for French haute cuisine, and his growing affections for Madame Mallory's pretty young sous chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon). Subsequently impressed by Hassan's undeniable culinary talents, Madame Mallory agrees to become Hassan's mentor, in the process providing the perfect creative environment where his unique fusion cuisine can thrive.",7.3,"$22,000,000 (estimated)","Helen Mirren,Om Puri,Manish Dayal,Charlotte Le Bon,Amit Shah,Farzana Dua Elahe,Dillon Mitra,Aria Pandya,Michel Blanc,Clément Sibony,Vincent Elbaz,Juhi Chawla,Alban Aumard,Shuna Lemoine,Antoine Blanquefort,Malcolm Granath,Abhijit Buddhisagar,Rohan Chand,Masood Akhtar,Arthur Mazet,Laetitia de Fombelle,Cédric Weber,Piero Filippi,Robert Gailhard,Matyelok Gibbs,Paul Daubeze,Didier Joy,Max Rangotte,Saachi Parekh,Shaunak Parekh,Stéphanie Renouvin,Audrey Meschi,Christian Allieres,Patrick Blatger,Frederic Violante,Chantal Filippi,Sanjay Sharma,Morgan Perez,Hélène Cardona,Jean Kinsella,Emanuele Secci",PG,Lasse Hallström,"Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,E1 Entertainment (UK),Nordisk Film Distribusjon,Constantin Film,Constantin Film,Entertainment One,Metropolitan Filmexport,Odeon,Pro Video Film & Distribution Kft.,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Argentina,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Japan,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Walt Disney Studios Sony Pictures Releasing (WDSSPR),Ascot Elite Entertainment Group,NOS Audiovisuais,Pinema,TriPictures,Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment,Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,Film1,Highlight Film,Odeon,Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment,Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment,RTL4","Amblin Entertainment,Dreamworks Pictures,Harpo Films,Imagenation Abu Dhabi FZ,India Take One Productions,Participant,Reliance Entertainment,Touchstone Pictures","Comedy,Drama",122

185,14. The Inbetweeners 2,2014,"Jay, Neil, Simon, and Will reunite in Australia for a holiday. Neil, Will, and Simon receive an invite from Jay to join him in Australia on his gap year, who promises them it's ''the sex capital of the world''. With their lives now rather dull compared to their hedonistic school days and legendary lads' holiday, it's an offer they can't refuse. Once again, they put growing up temporarily on-hold, and embark on the backpacking holiday of a lifetime in an awful car, inspired by Peter Andre's 'Mysterious Girl'. Will soon finds himself battling with the lads to do something cultural, while they focus their attention on drinking, girls, and annoying fellow travelers.—Production Friends Will McKenzie, Simon Cooper, Jay Cartwright, and Neil Sutherland have graduated from Rudge Park Comprehensive, where they were nowhere near being among the popular kids, but not total social outcasts either. Will's high-school life was made worse because of the antagonism between him and one of the school administrators, Mr. Phil Gilbert. Now separated, the friends' lives are outwardly not much better. Nerdish Will is attending uni in Bristol, where he has no real friends, though he's in denial of this. Simon, who is in a perpetual state of puppy love, is also at uni, but in Sheffield, so he could be with his girlfriend Lucy, whom he met on vacation in Greece. Simon doesn't want to admit that he really doesn't much like Lucy because of her controlling, violently-obsessive behavior towards him. Short of more than a few brain cells, Neil is working in a dead-end job. And all talk/no action Jay has moved to Sydney, Australia after breaking up with girlfriend Jane, a friend of Lucy's whom Jay met on that vacation in Greece and as always a bit embarrassed of because she was slightly overweight. According to Jay, he is now living in his Uncle Bryan's mansion, has a bevy of beauties catering to his every sexual need, and is the hippest DJ at the hottest club in town. Feeling down about their lives, Will, Simon, and Neil decide to take a four-week vacation to Australia: their first quest is to find and stay with Jay in the lap of luxury and fun. They soon discover that Jay's life is not even remotely close to what he reported. The friends' collective wants for the trip diverge when Will runs into Katie, whom he knew from prep school; she seems sexually attracted to him. Katie and the group she's traveling with are hip and outdoorsy, so Will tries to emulate them while he follow Katie around Australia. This not only puts him at odds with his friends but also with Ben, one of Katie's friends, who takes every opportunity to denigrate him in front of her. Meanwhile, Jay wants them all to spend their vacation at Splash Planet, a water park, but he doesn't tell them the real reason behind this choice of locale or the real reason he's in Australia. Through it all, Simon continues to negotiate his relationship with Lucy via Skype, but always ends up on the short end of the stick. As Will, Simon, Jay, and Neil spend time together and apart, their friendship is tested as they get into one misadventure after another.—Huggo",6.4,,"Simon Bird,James Buckley,Blake Harrison,Joe Thomas,Emily Berrington,Freddie Stroma,David Field,Belinda Stewart-Wilson,Tamla Kari,Lydia Rose Bewley,David Schaal,Alex Macqueen,Greg Davies,Martin Trenaman,Robin Weaver,Felicity Ward,Oliver Johnstone,Brad Kannegiesser,Susan Wokoma,Lucy Cohu,Tom Wren,Bibi Nerheim,Nelle Lee,Candice Storey,Cameron Caulfield,Kazuya Wright,Adam Nagaitis,Abigail Thaw,Claudia O'Doherty,Anthony Simcoe,Charnstar Anderson,Tori Aston,Oscar Bailey,Karishma Bhandari,Dana Blacklake,Steve Brody,Sophia Carr-Gomm,Brodie Cornish,Celeste Cotton,Julie Dryden,Michael Fowle,Matthew James French,Robin George,Emily Georgiou,Alex Gillison,Eric James Gravolin,George Hewer,Adam Honig-Joselyn,Matt Hookings,Matt Hurley,Aelin Jade,Larissa Jones,James Kearney,Alexandra Kelly,Attila G.

187,16. The Boxtrolls,2014,"A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator. THE BOXTROLLS are a community of quirky, mischievous creatures who have lovingly raised an orphaned human boy named Eggs in the amazing cavernous home they've built beneath the streets of a city called Cheesebridge. The story is about a young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors who tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator, the town's villain, Archibald Snatcher. When Snatcher comes up with a plot to get rid of the Boxtrolls. Eggs decides to venture above ground and ""into the light,"" where he meets and teams up with fabulously feisty Winnie. Together, they devise a daring plan to save The BoxTrolls family. The film is based upon the children's novel 'Here Be Monsters' by Alan Snow. Hidden deep into the bowels of the cheese-worshipping town of Cheesebridge, the mysterious and reclusive community of the harmless little critters known only as the Boxtrolls, have falsely earned the reputation of being a nocturnal clan of creatures who steal children, after adopting the orphaned baby boy, Eggs. Of course, this misleading rumour makes things a lot easier for the master Boxtroll exterminator, Archibald Snatcher, who thirsts to annihilate the entire species for his personal advantage; however, things will take a turn for the better when a grown-up Eggs resurfaces only to find an unexpected ally: the town lord's spirited daughter, Winnie. But, can the two of them come up with a bold strategy to save not only the remaining Boxtrolls' reputation but also their lives?—Nick Riganas Subterranean trolls raise an orphaned boy, who helps them fight back against an evil exterminator and make peace with the fearful residents of an upper-crust Victorian-era town known for its world-class cheeses. The two things the people of this posh town treasure most are their children and their cheeses; unfortunately, those are also the things that the Boxtrools - a race of unsightly, sewer-dwelling creatures - covet most. Clad in cast-off cardboard boxes as they scuttle about underground, the Boxtrolls may look like a fearsome bunch, they're actually quite friendly. Having previously adopted an orphaned infant named Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempstead-Wright), the diminutive tinkerers raise him as one of their own. Meanwhile, Eggs may be the Boxtrolls' only hope for survival when scheming exterminator Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley) seeks to earn his entry into the ultra-exclusive Cheesebridge society by eradicating the misunderstood creatures once and for all. Little does the villainous Snatcher realize that Eggs has a wealthy friend named Winnie (voiced by Ellie Fanning), and that Winnie may be the key to solving the longstanding feud between the people above, and the benevolent creatures below..",6.8,"$60,000,000 (estimated)","Steve Blum,Dee Bradley Baker,Max Mitchell,Ben Kingsley,Jared Harris,Nick Frost,Richard Ayoade,Tracy Morgan,Nika Futterman,Pat Fraley,Fred Tatasciore,Isaac Hempstead Wright,Elle Fanning,Maurice LaMarche,James Urbaniak,Brian George,Toni Collette,Simon Pegg,Lori Tritel,Laraine Newman,Reckless Jack,Ron Bottitta,Tom Kenny,Sam Lavagnino,Julian Stone",PG,"Graham Annable,Anthony Stacchi","CJ CGV Viet Nam,Entertainment One,Focus Features,Gaga,Reliance Entertainment,Solar Entertainment,United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures,Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Westec Media Limited,Anime Ltd,Anime Ltd,Blessed Filmes,CBBC,Channel 4,Feelgood Entertainment,Gaga,Gaga,ITVX,Kanal 11,Kanal 2,NOS Audiovisuais,Plaion Pictures,Plaion Pictures,SBS6,Universal Home Entertainment,Universal Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (UPHE),Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (UPHE),Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures,Universal Pictures,Waylen Group","Focus Features,Laika Entertainment","Animation,Adventure,Comedy,Family,Fantasy",96

196,25. Get on Up,2014,"A chronicle of James Brown's rise from extreme poverty to become one of the most influential musicians in history. On route to the stage, singer James Brown recalls a life with a turbulent childhood where music was his only constructive release for his passions. A chance demonstration of that in prison led to a new friend who helped get him out and into a musical career. With his fire and creative daring, Brown became a star who defiantly created new possibilities in show business both on and behind the stage in face of racism and conventional thinking. Along the way, James would also become a peacemaker who redefined and raised the African-American community's feeling of self-worth when it was needed most. However, those same domineering passions would lead James Brown alienating everyone around him as his appetites became ever more self-destructive. Only after he hit rock bottom with a serious mistake does Brown realize what he needs to do make his life as the Godfather of Soul truly worthwhile.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Get on Up is told using a nonlinear narrative as if through James Brown's stream of consciousness, including asynchronous events and frequent breaks in the fourth wall. The film opens in 1993 with James Brown walking through a darkened hallway as an audience chants his name. He hears the voices of people he knew throughout his life. The film then cuts to 1988 in Augusta, Georgia; James learns that his private bathroom in a strip mall he owns was used without his consent. As James confronts and then forgives the trespasser, James accidentally fires a shotgun, attracting the police. During the 1960s, James and his band decide to travel to Vietnam to show support to the black troops, where they put on a well-received show. In 1939, James is raised in the woods by his parents (Susie and Joe Brown), whose marriage is fraught with financial struggles and physical abuse. Later he performs in a singing group, The Famous Flames, formed by Bobby Byrd, whose family sponsored his release from prison, a penalty he paid for stealing a suit. James lives with the Byrd family and becomes lead singer of Bobby's group. In 1964, manager Ben Bart convinces them to let The Rolling Stones close The T.A.M.I. Show instead of The Flames. The Flames upstage the Stones, and, exiting the stage, James tells the Stones, ""Welcome to America"". In James' childhood, Susie leaves Joe, and Joe threatens her with a gun and keeps James. Joe continues to abuse James until Joe joins the army. James is left living with and working for his Aunt Honey, who runs a brothel. At her home, he attends church and enjoys the choir.",6.9,"$30,000,000 (estimated)","Chadwick Boseman,Nelsan Ellis,Dan Aykroyd,Viola Davis,Lennie James,Fred Melamed,Craig Robinson,Jill Scott,Octavia Spencer,Josh Hopkins,Brandon Mychal Smith,Tika Sumpter,Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor,Tariq Trotter,Aloe Blacc,Keith D.

197,1. This Is Where I Leave You,2014,"After their father passes away, four grown siblings are forced to return to their childhood home and live under the same roof for a week, along with their over-sharing mother and an assortment of spouses, exes, and might-have-beens. After their father passes away, four grown siblings, bruised and banged up by their respective adult lives, are forced to return to their childhood home and live under the same roof together for a week, along with their over-sharing mother and an assortment of spouses, exes, and might-have-beens. Confronting their history and the frayed states of their relationships among the people who know and love them best, they ultimately reconnect in hysterical and emotionally affecting ways amid the chaos, humor, heartache and redemption that only families can provide--driving us insane even as they remind us of our truest, and often best, selves.—Warner Bros. After an illness, sporting-goods store owner Mort Altman has just died, bringing his family and friends together to mourn his passing, his family wife and four adult offspring, who do not see each other often, partly because of geographic distance and largely because the siblings have totally different personalities. His family includes his liberally-minded wife Hilary, a therapist who used the family issues as the source for her widely successful books; third offspring Judd, a New York radio talk-show producer who has always had his life mapped out so does not respond well to anything throwing him off-course; second offspring Wendy, the proverbial glue of the family; oldest offspring Paul, the straight-laced responsible one who manages the store; and youngest offspring Phillip, the irresponsible one. Mort's last wish, which Hilary wants the family to observe, is for the family to sit shiva together at the family home. Their time together over the week is not good for some as the siblings deal with their current life issues. Judd is as thrown off-course as he's ever been, losing both his job and his wife Quinn in one fell swoop as he caught Quinn cheating on him with his boss, Wade. Wendy believes Judd will rebound with childhood friend Penny, who had always had a crush on him, before he returns to life with Quinn, as finding that preset path is what Judd does best. Wendy is married to workaholic businessman Barry, which makes her think about what life would have been like if she stayed with her childhood sweetheart Horry, who still lives across the street from Hilary with his mother, Linda, largely because of a brain injury he sustained in a car accident when he and Wendy were still dating. Linda, Hilary and Mort had long been best friends, who were there for each other during the good times and the bad, the latter which included Mort's illness and Horry's accident. Paul and his wife Annie, who Judd used to date, have been trying--unsuccessfully--to have a child. On top of Paul and Annie's family issue, Mort's death throws the state of the store into question, Paul who still believes it is rightly his despite having only fifty percent interest. And Phillip arrives on the scene with his current girlfriend Tracy, his former therapist who is closer in age to his mom than to himself. Phillip believes that Tracy has made him a more responsible human being holistically. Throughout the shiva, Hilary has her own agenda beyond mourning the passing of her husband.—Huggo When their father passes away, four grown, world-weary siblings return to their childhood home and are requested--with admonition--to stay there together for a week, along with their free-speaking mother and a collection of spouses, exes, and might-have-beens. As the brothers and sisters re-examine their shared history and the status of each tattered relationship among those who know and love them best, they reconnect in hysterically funny and emotionally significant ways.",6.6,"$19,800,000 (estimated)","Jason Bateman,Tina Fey,Jane Fonda,Adam Driver,Rose Byrne,Corey Stoll,Kathryn Hahn,Connie Britton,Timothy Olyphant,Dax Shepard,Debra Monk,Abigail Spencer,Ben Schwartz,Aaron Lazar,Cade Lappin,Will Swenson,Carol Schultz,Kevin McCormick,Evan Wadle,Olivia Oguma,Barbara Spiegel,Gerry Vichi,Cheryl Stern,Beth Leavel,Carly Brooke,Michael Bryan French,Lance Roberts,Carolyn Seiff,Brahm Schenkman,Cantor Mia Fram Davidson,Crystal Dickinson,Kenneth De Abrew,Oakes Fegley,Scot Charles Anderson,Michael Barra,Barbara Bleier,Brady Bryson,Caryn Cherlin,Alexandra Jordyn,Paul Jude Letersky,John Archer Lundgren,Clayton Sauer,George Schroeder",R,Shawn Levy,"Warner Bros.,Warner Home Video,Warner Home Video,SF Film Finland,SF Norge A/S,Warner Bros.

211,"15. Men, Women & Children",2014,"A group of high school teenagers and their parents attempt to navigate the many ways the Internet has changed their relationships, their communications, their self-images, and their love lives. This movie follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-images, and their love lives. This movie attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.—Paramount Pictures The effect of on-line connection 24/7 is examined through a group of east Texas high school students and their parents. Don Truby (Adam Sandler) and Helen Truby's (Rosemarie Dewitt's) marriage has long been disintegrating about which they both do not speak. While Don early in their problems turned to Internet porn, he now addicted, they both eventually turn to the Internet to find extramarital sex partners to fulfill what is missing in their marriage. Their son, Chris Truby (Travis Tope), who Don discovers is also watching porn on the Internet, which Don solely sees as a rite of passage, is having increasing difficulties in maintaining an erection when it doesn't include anything he considers outside the sexual norm, which may make it difficult for him when he has his first sexual encounter probably of the vanilla variety. Allison Doss (Elena Kampouris) turns to the Internet for any support she can find in maintaining her weight loss, which she is doing solely through controlling her food intake. Her extreme weight loss is largely to attract the attention of fellow student Brandon Lender (Will Peltz), on whom she has long had a crush and who she wants to be her first kiss. It's been a year since Lydia Mooney (Candace Lantz) headed to Los Angeles, California with her boyfriend Greg Cherry (Jon Michael Davis), in the process, leaving her husband Kent Mooney (Dean Norris) and son Tim Mooney (Ansel Elgort). Football star Tim, who has come to the conclusion of one's own insignificance within the grand scheme of the cosmos, has decided not to play football this year against the wants of the school and Kent, turning to on-line gaming of the D and D variety to while away his time. What he has not told Kent is that he secretly follows his mother on Facebook to feel connected to her despite her absence. Patricia Beltmeyer (Jennifer Garner), who teaches Internet protection to other parents and students, monitors every keystroke daughter Brandy Beltmeyer (Kaitlyn Dever) does on her computer, Patricia checking the computer and Brandy's phone once a week as extra security. Although Patricia has never found anything to cause her concern, what Patricia's actions have done is drive Brandy's on-line activities that she does not want her mother to know underground. And former failed actress Donna Clint (Judy Greer) supports her daughter Hannah Clint's (Olivia Crocicchia's) drive to become famous, most specifically in becoming an actress. Donna believes the best way to achieve this goal is for Hannah to have her own webpage, which has increasingly been populated with provocative images of Hannah. Hannah takes that message from her mother a step further by portraying herself as a sexually active being in believing that is what will attract the attention of those who matter.—Huggo Based on the novel of the same name by Chad Kultgen, the movie features Adam Sandler and Rosemarie DeWitt as a married couple who each use the internet to find lovers, Judy Greer as a failed actress who spends much of her time pushing her daughter's career through a website, and Jennifer Garner as a mother who takes every precaution to make sure she knows what her daughter does on-line.",6.6,"$16,000,000 (estimated)","Adam Sandler,Jennifer Garner,Rosemarie DeWitt,Judy Greer,Dean Norris,Emma Thompson,Timothée Chalamet,Olivia Crocicchia,Kaitlyn Dever,Ansel Elgort,Katherine Hughes,Elena Kampouris,Will Peltz,Travis Tope,David Denman,Dennis Haysbert,J.K.

212,16. Still Alice,2014,"A linguistics professor and her family find their bonds tested when she is diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. Alice Howland is a renowned linguistics professor happily married with three grown children. All that begins to change when she strangely starts to forget words and then more. When her doctor diagnoses her with Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, Alice and her family's lives face a harrowing challenge as this terminal degenerative neurological ailment slowly progresses to an inevitable conclusion they all dread. Along the way, Alice struggles to not only to fight the inner decay, but to make the most of her remaining time to find the love and peace to make simply living worthwhile.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Dr. Alice Howland is a renowned linguistics professor at Columbia University. When words begin to escape her and she starts becoming lost on her daily jogs, Alice must come face-to-face with a devastating diagnosis: early-onset Alzheimer's disease. As the once-vibrant woman struggles to hang on to her sense of self for as long as possible, Alice's three grown children must watch helplessly as their mother disappears more and more with each passing day.—Jwelch5742 Alice Howland, a 50-year-old mother of three and accomplished Columbia University linguistics professor, is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. After all, deceptively innocent slips of the tongue, short-term memory losses during lectures, and shocking disorientation attacks inside the campus were all alarming signs of Alice's condition. Now, her mind slowly slips away, and Alice realises that, eventually, she will cease to recognise her beloved children. As a result, rapid degeneration alienates Alice, forcing her to turn invisible. When every moment counts, can Alice summon the strength to prevail?—Nick Riganas Coinciding with her fiftieth birthday, Columbia University based Alice Howland, one of the preeminent academics in the field of linguistics, uncharacteristically begins to have the occasional lapse in memory, it arguably not recognizing any of her surroundings while out for a regular run around campus that makes her worry about the diagnosis from the neurologist, who she has not yet told anyone she is seeing. With her fellow Columbia University academic husband John Howland ultimately by her side, she does receive the diagnosis that she is suffering from early onset Alzheimer's, a rare form genetically transmitted, which will have obvious consequences for their three offspring, especially now for eldest daughter Anna Howland-Jones, she and her husband Charlie Howland-Jones who are trying to have a child. Dealing with the effects of the disease will affect all the Howlands, but beyond Alice herself, it is John on who the greatest effect will be felt as Alice's primary caregiver and as he and Alice have to make decisions affecting their lives, both personally and professionally. Although the furthest away geographically, their youngest daughter, Lydia Howland, who is trying to make it as an actor in Los Angeles, may be most affected by Alice's actions, as Lydia has always resisted Alice's pressures to go to college, if even in drama, as a fallback to the acting. As Alice herself begins to see and understand how the disease is affecting her day-to-day life, she, without divulging her plans, takes steps early in the diagnosis to ensure that she deals with the effects of the disease on her own terms.—Huggo",7.5,"$5,000,000 (estimated)","Julianne Moore,Kate Bosworth,Shane McRae,Hunter Parrish,Alec Baldwin,Seth Gilliam,Kristen Stewart,Stephen Kunken,Erin Darke,Daniel Gerroll,Quincy Tyler Bernstine,Maxine Prescott,Orlagh Cassidy,Rosa Arredondo,Zillah Glory,Caridad Martinez,Cal Freundlich,Charlotte Robson,Dan Adams,Jean Burns,José Báez,Victoria Cartagena,Jeannette Gould,Takako Haywood,Samantha Kelly,Diane Kimbrell,Cat Lynch,Kristin Macomber,Joanne Perica,Jamie Lee Petronis,Christopher Seufert,Nancy Ellen Shore,Eha Urbsalu,Gail Yudain",PG-13,"Richard Glatzer,Wash Westmoreland","Sony Pictures Classics,Artificial Eye,Big Picture 2 Films,Bir Film,Curzon Film World,Diamond Films,Feelgood Entertainment,Frenetic Films,Golden Scene,Golden Village Pictures,Golem Distribución,Good Films,Green Narae Media,Icon Film Distribution Australia,Kino Films,Mongrel Media,SF Film Finland,September Film,AB Svensk Filmindustri,CatchPlay,Evangelische Omroep (EO),Falcon Films,Falcon,Film1,Filmcompagniet,Filmladen,Forefront Media Group,Golem Distribución,Gulf Film,Lev Films,Mono Film,Orange Entertainment,Polyband,Sony Pictures Classics,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Releasing,Venus,Yleisradio (YLE)","BSM Studio,Lutzus-Brown,Killer Films,Big Indie Pictures,Shriver Films,Backup Media",Drama,101

As he eases into adulthood at the age of forty, Conrad Valmont (Jason Bateman), the over-educated, under-employed heir to the Valmont Hotel fortune, is cut off from his allowance following his parents abrupt divorce and tossed out into the unforgiving streets of the Upper West Side. Luckily, he is taken in by his old friend Dylan (Billy Crudup), and returns the favor by immediately falling for Dylan's girlfriend Beatrice (Olivia Wilde). As Conrad attempts to woo Beatrice while keeping both their relationship and his bank balance secret, Dylan tries to set him up with Jocelyn (Jenny Slate). Ever committed to the charade that he eventually finds difficult to maintain, Conrad quickly realizes his charm can only extend so far into debt. Now deep into an extensional reflection, will it take losing everything to make Conrad realize what he can truly become?—Official Source Approaching forty, Conrad Valmont has not worked a day in his life, he having lived off the wealth of his parents, who he has not seen of late as they are on a perpetual around the world trip. Conrad, however, tells people that he is working on the quintessential New York novel, it always being in the information gathering stages. Conrad grew up and still lives in the family's lavish, old world Manhattan hotel, where he was raised by servants. He has never been in a serious relationship, those available women he finding sexually attractive a bore, and those he finding interesting to who he is not sexually attracted. Whenever he has stayed with a woman for longer than one night has always been solely in not wanting to be alone. His longtime best and only real friend is equally wealthy Dylan Tate, whose money is self made as a successful artist, and who is a socialist at that. Also unlike Conrad, Dylan takes love seriously, he and his last girlfriend, Jocelyn, with who he just broke up, lasting for three years. Out of circumstance and without previous notification, Conrad's parents cut him off meaning that he has to move out of the hotel immediately with no money and find his own means of living. The subsequent week in Conrad's life is presented, that week which includes he: borrowing a couple of hundred dollars from his longtime therapist, Barry, to get him going; moving in with Dylan, who he does not tell about his new financial situation; falling in love for the first time, with Beatrice Fairbanks, a model and aspiring musician, she who happens to be the woman Dylan is also pursuing; and starting a clandestine relationship with Beatrice - a woman he could see being the one - despite vowing to Dylan that he would not hit on her, Dylan who could see his attraction to her. The primary questions become what will happen to Conrad's relationships with both Dylan and Beatrice when they inevitably find out about his financial situation and with Dylan specifically about breaking his vow concerning Beatrice, and whether during this week Conrad will take steps to truly growing up, something that has not happened in forty years.—Huggo",5.4,N/A,"Jason Bateman,Tony Roberts,Laura Clery,William Abadie,Stephen Temperly,Alexandra Neil,Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick,Barry Primus,Olivia Wilde,Billy Crudup,Jayce Bartok,Danny Deferrari,Auden Thornton,Steve Witting,Maureen Mueller,Nicole Elizabeth Berger,Ann W.

217,21. Before I Go to Sleep,2014,"A woman wakes up every day, remembering nothing as a result of a traumatic accident in her past. One day, new terrifying truths emerge that force her to question everyone around her. Forty year old Christine Lucas wakes up in bed with a man she does not know, in an unfamiliar house. The man explains that he is her husband, Ben, and that she suffered brain damage from a car accident ten years earlier. Christine wakes up every morning with no memory of her life from her early twenties onwards. Christine receives treatment from Dr. Nasch, a neurologist at a local hospital who provides her a camera to record her thoughts and progress each day, and calls her every morning to remind her to watch the video in the camera. Soon, she starts to discover the truth around her.—Nebzyl Every day, the housewife Christine Lucas wakes up with a stranger in her bed that explains that he is her husband Ben. He tells that she had a car accident many years ago, where their son Adam died, and she had a brain damage that erases her memory during the night. Then she receives a phone call from Dr. Mike Nasch, who had treated her, and he reminds her to find a hidden camera and watch a video to help her cure. Soon Christine joins her pieces of memory like a puzzle and starts to recall her life and discover the truth about Ben.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Each night, after falling asleep, Christine, the forty-year-old car-crash survivor who now suffers from anterograde amnesia, loses all her memories back to her twenties. And each day, Christine finds herself waking up next to Ben; the perfect stranger who claims that he is her husband. To compensate for her utter inability to form new recollections, Christine faithfully keeps a meticulous and illuminating video diary after her psychologist Dr Nasch's directions, hoping to piece together her fragmented existence. Little by little, sudden and uncomfortable flashbacks start to unravel the thick mystery of Christine's deep trauma; but, in the process, whom should she trust?—Nick Riganas Every morning, chemistry teacher Ben explains to his wife Christine she woke up with amnesia daily as a result of a car crash twenty years ago.

The Book of Life,2014,"Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastic worlds where he must face his greatest fears. From producer Guillermo del Toro and director Jorge Gutierrez comes an animated comedy with a unique visual style. THE BOOK OF LIFE is the journey of Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart. Before choosing which path to follow, he embarks on an incredible adventure that spans three fantastical worlds where he must face his greatest fears. Rich with a fresh take on pop music favorites, THE BOOK OF LIFE encourages us to celebrate the past while looking forward to the future.—20th Century Fox Mary Beth, a museum tour guide, takes a group of school detention students on a secret museum tour, telling them, with wooden figures, the story of a Mexican town called San Angel from the Book of Life, holding every story in the world. On the Day of the Dead, La Muerte, ruler of the Land of the Remembered, and Xibalba, ruler of the Land of the Forgotten, see Manolo Sánchez and Joaquín Mondragon competing over María Posada. They strike a wager: if María marries Manolo, Xibalba will no longer interfere in mortal affairs, but if she marries Joaquín, La Muerte and Xibalba will swap realms. However, Xibalba cheats by giving Joaquín his Medal of Everlasting Life, which grants the wearer invincibility. While visiting a museum, a group of five troubled youth, on detention, are won over by their tour guide, Mary Beth. Part of what wins them over is the story she tells from the Book of Life, which contains all the stories of the world, both true and made-up. The story she tells centers on the Day of the Dead in San Angel, Mexico - the center of the universe - of three childhood best friends, strong-willed María Posada, Joaquín Mondragon Jr., who likes to show he's a man by sporting a fake mustache without truly knowing what it means to be a man, and guitar-playing Manolo Sánchez, the offspring of the town's general, a deceased military hero and a bullfighter respectively. Even at this age, both Joaquín and Manolo are in love with María, each knowing he would like eventually to marry her. They are separated when María's father sends her to Europe for school to learn to be a lady. By the time María returns to San Angel as a young woman, Joaquín has become a military hero like his father, and Manolo has become a bullfighter like all his Sánchez ancestors, male and female. While Manolo showed his aptitude for bullfighting at a young age, his heart still remains music, singing and playing his guitar, and not with bullfighting. Each still pines for María as his wife. What they are unaware of is that two leaders of the afterlife, estranged wife and husband, La Muerte, ruler of the Land of the Remembered, and Xibalba, ruler of the Land of the Forgotten, long ago made a wager on which of the two will marry María, the outcome which will have a profound effect not only on María, Joaquín and Manolo's joint lives, but the course of San Angel, which is constantly under threat by evil Chakal, and the world. What La Muerte is further unaware of is that Xibalba is taking underhanded measures to win, which also affects María, Joaquín and Manolo's live and possible deaths.—Huggo",7.2,"$50,000,000 (estimated)","Diego Luna,Zoe Saldaña,Channing Tatum,Ron Perlman,Christina Applegate,Ice Cube,Kate del Castillo,Hector Elizondo,Danny Trejo,Carlos Alazraqui,Ana de la Reguera,Emil-Bastien Bouffard,Elijah Rodriguez,Genesis Ochoa,Plácido Domingo,Jorge R.

256,10. Selma,2014,"A chronicle of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. The unforgettable true story chronicles the tumultuous three-month period in 1965 when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led a dangerous campaign to secure equal voting rights in the face of violent opposition. The epic march from Selma to Montgomery culminated in President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most significant victories for the civil rights movement. Director Ava DuVernay's ""Selma"" tells the story of how the revered leader and visionary Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his brothers and sisters in the movement prompted change that forever altered history.—Miss W J Mcdermott While Black citizens of 1965 Alabama constitutionally have the same voting rights as whites, they are hamstrung by racist local registration officers, politicians, and lawmen.

Four black girls walking down stairs in the Birmingham, Alabama 16th Street Baptist Church are killed by a bomb set by the Ku Klux Klan. Annie Lee Cooper attempts to register to vote in Selma, Alabama but is prevented by the white registrar. King meets with Lyndon B. Johnson and asks for federal legislation to allow black citizens to register to vote unencumbered, but the president responds that, although he understands Dr. King's concerns, he has more important projects. King travels to Selma with Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, James Orange, and Diane Nash. James Bevel greets them, and other SCLC activists appear. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover tells Johnson that King is a problem, and suggests that they disrupt his marriage. Coretta Scott King has concerns about her husband's upcoming work in Selma. King calls singer Mahalia Jackson to inspire him with a song. King, other SCLC leaders, and Black Selma residents march to the registration office to register. After a confrontation in front of the courthouse, a shoving match occurs as the police go into the crowd. Cooper fights back, knocking Sheriff Jim Clark to the ground, leading to the arrest of Cooper, King, and others.

257,11. Big Eyes,2014,"A drama about the awakening of painter Margaret Keane, her phenomenal success in the 1950s, and the subsequent legal difficulties she had with her husband, who claimed credit for her works in the 1960s. In San Francisco in the 1950s, Margaret was a woman trying to make it on her own after leaving her husband with only her daughter and her paintings. While struggling to make an impact with her drawings of children with big eyes, she meets gregarious ladies' man and fellow painter Walter Keane in a park. The two quickly become a pair with outgoing Walter selling their paintings and quiet Margaret holed up at home painting even more children with big eyes, but Walter's actually selling her paintings as his own. A clash of financial success and critical failure soon sends Margaret reeling in her life of lies. With Walter still living the high life, Margaret's going to have to try making it on her own again and reclaiming her name and her paintings.—Anne Campbell The story opens in the late 1950s, when Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) packs up the car with her daughter and their personal belongings, and leaves her husband to start a new life in San Francisco. There, Margaret quickly reconnects with her old friend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter) and falls head over heels for Walter (Christoph Waltz), an artist and part-time real-estate broker who soon shows great interest in her unique paintings of small children with strikingly expressive, saucer-like eyes. Before long, the two are married, with Walter claiming credit for Margaret's increasingly popular paintings. With money rolling in, Margaret initially agrees to go along with the ruse, but the closer she gets to her new husband, the more she begins to realize that he's little more than a smooth-talking scam artist. Later, riddled with guilt over the fact that she's been deceiving her own daughter as her paintings become a pop-culture phenomenon, Margaret leaves the increasingly abusive Walter and moves to Hawaii. Only then does Margaret gain the confidence to reclaim the works that have been credited to her husband, even when doing so entails going before a judge and proving that she and she alone created the enchanting children with the big eyes.",7.0,"$10,000,000 (estimated)","Amy Adams,Christoph Waltz,Danny Huston,Krysten Ritter,Jason Schwartzman,Terence Stamp,Jon Polito,Delaney Raye,Madeleine Arthur,James Saito,Farryn VanHumbeck,Guido Furlani,Elisabetta Fantone,Emily Maddison,Brent Chapman,Gabe Khouth,Dylan Kingwell,Peter Kelamis,Deni DeLory,Desiree Zurowski,Vincent Gale,Fred Keating,Byron Bertram,Heather Doerksen,Eliza Norbury,Ryan Beil,Frenchy Gagne,Fiona Vroom,Jill Morrison,Leela Savasta,Linda Sato,Traci Toguchi,Stephanie Bennett,Andrea Bucko,Emily Fonda,Aaron Craven,Lear Howard,Heather Ireland,Linda Marr,Doreen McKenzie,Elizabeth Urrea,Kari-Ann Wood,Dale Wolfe,Patricia Mayen-Salazar,Tony Alcantar,Darren Dolynski,David Milchard,Andrew Airlie,Forbes Angus,Michael Kopsa,Alan MacFarlane,Thomas Potter,Colleen Winton,Pomaika'i Brown,Dan Cooke,L.G.

259,13. A Most Violent Year,2014,"In New York City 1981, an ambitious immigrant fights to protect his business and family during the most dangerous year in the city's history. A crime drama set in New York City during the winter of 1981--statistically one of the most violent years in the city's history--and centered on the lives of an immigrant and his family trying to expand their business and capitalize on opportunities as the rampant violence, decay, and corruption of the day drag them in and threaten to destroy all they have built.—Production In 1981 New York City, Abel Morales, from an immigrant background, is trying to live the American Dream on his own moral terms. Married to WASP Anna Morales née Robbins, Abel bought Standard, his father-in-law's heating-oil distribution business operating in the New York market. Operating totally above board, Abel has made such a success of the business that he, Anna, and their two daughters are moving into a palatial new mansion. It looks like he is the front-runner among those competing to purchase a $2.5-million prime riverside property that would allow him to expand the business and become the largest New York heating-oil distributor. If successful in his proposal--$1 million of his own money down, with the remaining $1.5 million, financed through the bank, due in 30 days--this purchase would be the most important business move of his career. However, the industry in New York is known to be fraught with illegal activity, so much so that the Assistant D.A., Mr. Lawrence, has been tasked with cleaning up the crime ingrained in the industry. Anna's father and most if not all of Abel's major competitors were and are corrupt. Lawrence's investigation includes looking into Abel's business during his father-in-law's ownership, and Abel could be charged if they look into the books from those years despite Abel having done nothing wrong himself. He and Anna haven't yet been able to go through the books themselves to hide whatever is required to remain clean. Also, someone--most likely one of his major competitors, is using scare tactics and intimidation to bring him down: hijacking his trucks, so far to the tune of $200,000 worth of stolen oil, beating up his drivers, beating up his salesmen, and making veiled personal threats against him and his family. Even if it is not one of his major competitors orchestrating these attacks, he knows at least one of them is in collusion, as the amount of oil stolen could not be stored anywhere but at one of their facilities. Anna, who is more cutthroat than her husband, wants Abel to fight back using whatever tools, including like violence, to protect himself, the business, and their family. As Abel tries to remain true to himself, Julian, one of his immigrant drivers who was severely beaten during one of those hijackings, could undermine all that Abel has achieved so far, as Julian strives for his own piece of the American Dream.—Huggo",6.9,"$20,000,000 (estimated)","Oscar Isaac,Elyes Gabel,Jessica Chastain,Lorna Pruce,Christopher Abbott,Matthew Maher,Albert Brooks,Jerry Adler,Quinn Meyers,Chester Jones III,David Oyelowo,Ashley Williams,Glenn Fleshler,Jimmy Palumbo,Daisy Tahan,Taylor Richardson,Giselle Eisenberg,Tanner,Phillip Chi,Patrick Breen,Ben Rosenfield,Nick Bailey,Jenilyn Rodriguez,Linda Marie Larson,Peter Gerety,Alessandro Nivola,John Procaccino,Jason Ralph,Stephen Reich,Myrna Cabello,Nat DeWolf,Elizabeth Marvel,Robert Clohessy,Catalina Sandino Moreno,Russell G.

276,5. The Interview,2014,"Dave Skylark and his producer Aaron Rapaport run the celebrity tabloid show ""Skylark Tonight"". When they land an interview with a surprise fan, North Korean dictator Jong-Un Kim, they are recruited by the CIA to assassinate him. In the action-comedy The Interview, Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) run the popular celebrity tabloid TV show ""Skylark Tonight."" When they discover that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is a fan of the show, they land an interview with him in an attempt to legitimize themselves as journalists. As Dave and Aaron prepare to travel to Pyongyang, their plans change when the CIA recruits them, perhaps the two least-qualified men imaginable, to assassinate Kim Jong-un.—Sony Pictures Entertainment The CIA recruits a talk-show host ""James Franco"" and his producer ""Seth Rogen"" to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-UN in this comedy from writer/director duo Rogen and Evan Goldberg ""This Is the End"". Franco plays Dave Skylark, a vapid talk-show host known for chasing celebrity gossip, while Rogen is his producer Aaron Rapaport, who's desperate to do more serious journalism. When Dave discovers that North Korean leader Kim Jong-UN, played here by Randall Park is a big fan of his show, the pair decides to arrange an interview with him in order to boost their credibility. And the CIA, in turn, decide to use these two and the access they'll have to assassinate Kim. Aaron is all for it, but Dave is an easily swayed idiot who quickly falls under Kim's spell and begins to see the dictator as a wounded man-child rather than someone worth killing. Egotistical yet charismatic entertainment interviewer Dave Skylark, who has a frat boy mentality in needing the ""money"" moment in anything he does and who is not the brightest light in the world, was nothing until his producer of ten years, Aaron Rapaport, now his best friend, came on board his pop culture based interview television show, Skylark Tonight. After running into a former journalism school colleague, Aaron begins to lament not working in a harder hitting news milieu. As such, Aaron, after learning that the subject in question is a big fan of Dave's, convinces Dave that who he should interview is North Korean dictator Jong-Un Kim, his totalitarian regime which has just been able to achieve a missile strike reaching as far as the west coast of the United States from the Korean peninsula. Although the negotiations with the North Koreans do not end quite the way Aaron wants, he is still able to secure what will be the planned live worldwide broadcast interview, with he and Dave needing to travel to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to do so. It is then that CIA Agents Lacey and Botwin approach Dave and Aaron with their ask for the country: for Dave to assassinate Kim, it which can never be tied back to them (much to Dave's chagrin in again wanting that money moment of glory for himself) or the United States in any way. Landing in North Korea, Dave and Aaron find that some of their preconceived perceptions are different than what they experience. As the plan starts to go sideways for one reason or another, as they have to sift through what is real and what is fantasy, as they have to sift through who and who not to trust, and as they begin to reassess what they are actually about to do and their priorities, it looks as if Dave and Aaron may not make it out this situation alive. But in the process, Dave may discover something about himself and of what he is capable.—Huggo",6.5,"$44,000,000 (estimated)","James Franco,Seth Rogen,Lizzy Caplan,Randall Park,Diana Bang,Timothy Simons,Reese Alexander,James Yi,Paul Bae,Geoff Gustafson,Dominique Lalonde,Anesha Bailey,Anders Holm,Charles Rahi Chun,Don Chow,Colin Foo,Larry Hoe,Cleo Yeh,Yuna Song,Michelle Kim,Peenkay Tang,Lia Lam,Hazeltine Gariza,Willem Jacobson,Daniel Lim,Harrison Lee,Jason Cox,John Coughlin,Peter Neilly,Yoosik Oum,Scott Seol,Daniel Junghuan Park,Justin Lee,Don Lew,Andrew Chin,Jung Jin Park,Dan Sterling,Fred Henderson,Dan Shea,Tommy Chang,Justin Cho,David Kim,Adrian de Lotz,Hong-Gill Cha,Sean Cho,Dave Ko,Jack Jekeon Cha,William 'Big Sleeps' Stewart,Joe Mande,Alice Wetterlund,Stacey Turner,Sam Catlin,Guy Fieri,Ben Schwartz,Danyella Angel,Alan Blumenfeld,Paola Botero,Chelsea Braun,Thomas Cadrot,Steve Chang,Curt Clendenin,David Diaan,Oliver Drawson,Eminem,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Jinwoo Jung,Song Kang-ho,Sean Kennedy,DaeYoung Danny Kim,James Kyson,Won Hee Lee,Nicole G.

279,8. Annie,2014,"A foster kid who lives with her mean foster mom sees her life change when business tycoon and New York City mayoral candidate Will Stacks makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. The 1977 Broadway musical returns to the big screen with this Overbrook Entertainment/Sony Pictures production surrounding a 10-year-old Harlem foster child (""Beasts of the Southern Wild""'s Quvenzhané Wallis) taken in by a calculating billionaire (Jamie Foxx) who's campaigning to be mayor. Abandoned by her biological parents as a baby, Annie spends every moment of every day attempting to avoid the wrath of her cruel foster mother Miss Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz), but things start looking up for her when she has a very public encounter with Will Stacks (Foxx), a local cell-phone mogul with mayoral ambitions. Stacks' campaign isn't going too well until he meets Annie and invites her into his home at the suggestion of his trusted top assistant Grace (Rose Byrne) and his ambitious PR advisor Guy (Bobby Cannavale). Meanwhile, what was originally conceived as a PR stunt to win over skeptical voters becomes something much more personal when the jaded tycoon realizes his little friend is much more than a mere good-luck charm. Annie is a young, happy foster kid who's also tough enough to make her way on the streets of New York in 2014. Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd come back for her someday, it's been a hard-knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Colleen Hannigan. But everything's about to change when hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks--advised by his brilliant VP Grace, and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor, Guy--makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.—Sony Pictures Entertainment In this modern remake of the classic Broadway show ""Annie"", Annie is portrayed as an African-American tween hopelessly lost within the New York City foster-care system but smart, tough, and bright enough to survive the fast-paced New York City streets. Forced to stay with her mean foster mom, Miss Colleen Hannigan, Annie somehow manages to tough it out in Harlem until one day she accidentally and literally runs into wealthy billionaire and NYC mayoral candidate Will Stacks. Saving her from almost being hit by a car (while simultaneously being videotaped by an unknown passerby) Stacks and his political team decide to use the life-saving incident to boost his polls for the upcoming NYC election. Taking Annie into his penthouse home, Stacks begins to fall ""head-over-heels"" for the adorable little Annie. Meanwhile, Annie only has one hope and that is for her parents to someday return and rescue her from the foster care program.—DeAlan Wilson on ComedyE",5.4,"$65,000,000 (estimated)","Jamie Foxx,Quvenzhané Wallis,Rose Byrne,Bobby Cannavale,Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje,David Zayas,Cameron Diaz,Zoe Colletti,Nicolette Pierini,Eden Duncan-Smith,Amanda Troya,Dorian Missick,Tracie Thoms,Mike Birbiglia,Stephanie Kurtzuba,Peter Van Wagner,Ray Iannicelli,Michael J.

One day, Plankton attacks the Krusty Krab in an attempt to steal the formula. After a military battle involving giant foods and condiments, Plankton feigns surrender and uses a decoy of himself to give Mr. Krabs a fake penny, which the real Plankton then hides inside in order to gain access to Krabs' vault.

Doug Harris (Josh Gad) is a lovable but socially awkward groom-to-be with a problem: he has no best man. With less than two weeks to go until he marries the girl of his dreams (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), Doug is referred to Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart), owner and CEO of Best Man, Inc., a company that provides flattering best men for socially challenged guys in need. What ensues is a hilarious wedding charade as they try to pull off the big con, and an unexpected budding bromance between Doug and his fake best man Jimmy.—Sony Pictures Entertainment Elated to finally have found a bride in bossy Gretchen Palmer, goofy nerd Doug Harris, who never had a proper adult social life, got caught in his own lies about suitable friends as best man and seven groomsmen with unfortunately detailed characteristics. Doug's gay Mexican wedding planner, who fears a no-show in a few weeks, discretely refers him to Best Man, Inc., the private agency of slick bachelor Jimmy Callahan, who helps men trough daunting weddings for a living, yet considers this case an unprecedented-daunting 'golden tuxedo'. Still, paranymphs are recruited and like the groom trained intensively for their parts. Doug and Jimmy, whose character is army chaplain Bic, meet the Palmer future in-laws, and are dares to an American football match which proves less then friendly, in fact as painful as masked-abducted Doug's wild bachelor party, yet some bromance also blossoms. Still, hearing the unromantic truth from the bride's mouth on wedding day proves the crucial obstacle.—KGF Vissers Doug Harris (Josh Gad) is a nice guy with a high-powered job and a gorgeous fiancee, but with only one week to go before his big wedding to his dream girl Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), he has yet to find his best man. Cue Jimmy Callahan (Hart) the owner of Best Man Inc., which provides a rather unique service for men who need to juice up their weddings: For a fee, Jimmy will be your best man -- and not just any best man, but one whom your guests will be talking about for years to come.. With ten days until his wedding to Gretchen Palmer, the type of woman he thought he could never get in she being proverbially way out of his league, successful accountant Doug Harris has finally admitted to himself that he not only doesn't have friends to fill the seven groomsmen's spots to match Gretchen's seven bridesmaids, but that none of his current or former acquaintances feels comfortable enough to accept the role of best man in he having no true friends. Beyond the under pressure story he came up with of the best man being someone named Bic Mitchum, an army priest currently serving in El Salvador, Doug doesn't want to tell Gretchen about this issue in wanting the wedding to go perfectly for her. Seeing what is happening with Doug and knowing that this problem will throw a wrench into his vision for the wedding, Edmundo, their stereotypically effeminate wedding planner, points Doug in the direction of the figurative and literal underground business, The Best Man Inc., operated by Jimmy Callahan, his service to act as a best man at weddings for such friendless men like Doug, complete with a ""best buds"" back story. No matter what package any of his clients purchase, the one thing that Jimmy is up front to them about is that their relationship is solely business, any pretense of friendship just that: pretend. Doug feels that he has to go off the list of services Jimmy offers for what Jimmy refers to as ""the golden tux"" package - price tag: $50,000 - as it entails something more elaborate than Jimmy has ever perpetrated, especially in finding seven groomsmen, the nine of them who have to show Gretchen and the world that they indeed have long been the closest of friends. Beyond anything that may expose their ruse, especially to Gretchen, complications ensue when Doug, for the first time in his life, has a group of men he truly considers his friends, even if he had to pay $50,000 for their services. The question then becomes if Jimmy feels the same way, he never having gone to this extent in his services and thus never having gotten to know a client more so than Doug.—Huggo",6.6,"$23,000,000 (estimated)","Kevin Hart,Josh Gad,Affion Crockett,Kaley Cuoco,Jorge Garcia,Dan Gill,Corey Holcomb,Ken Howard,Colin Kane,Cloris Leachman,Jenifer Lewis,Alan Ritchson,Mimi Rogers,Aaron Takahashi,Olivia Thirlby,Whitney Cummings,Ignacio Serricchio,Nicky Whelan,Patrick Carlyle,GloZell Green,Tristin Mays,Robert Towers,Neal Israel,Justine Ezarik,Tyler Michael Brown,Peter Gilroy,Josh Peck,Hal Jeffrin,Rawson Marshall Thurber,Amy Okuda,Jeffrey Ross,Joe Namath,John Riggins,Ed 'Too Tall' Jones,David Burr,Anthony L.

Some aliens, who travel from planet to planet to see what kind of species inhabit them, come to Earth. And if humans are, according to their standards, decent, they are welcomed to be their friend. And if not, the planet is destroyed. To find out, they choose one inhabitant and give that person the power to do whatever he or she wants. And they choose Neil Clarke (Simon Pegg), a teacher who teaches the special kids. He is constantly being berated by the headmaster and is attracted to his neighbor, Catherine (Kate Beckinsale), but doesn't have the guts to approach her. But now he can do anything he wants, but has to be careful.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Neil Clarke (Simon Pegg), a teacher who has a very bad life and lives in a flat with his dog, Dennis (Mojo and Robin Williams), gets special powers to do absolutely anything which was given to him by a group of aliens. When he has these powers, he has to be very careful with them because otherwise it could lead to misery. The Pioneer 11 space probe, containing information about the human race, is found by the Intergalactic Council of Superior Beings. They debate whether to destroy the Earth or make humanity a member of the council. Their decision protocol calls for a test - they will select one human at random and grant limitless power to him/her, ""absolutely anything"". After ten days, if the powers were used for evil, Earth will be destroyed. The chosen human is Neil Clarke, a struggling teacher. Neil has a crush on his neighbor, Catherine West. Oblivious to his new power, Neil first wishes for aliens to destroy 10C, his class of ill-behaved students. It happens. When he realizes what he's done, he wishes for all the dead people to be restored to life. Of course, every cemetery is quickly full of corpses crawling from their graves. He quickly corrects his far too general wish. The next ten days are filled with him learning to be quite specific in stating his wishes and undoing many of them.

326,"6. McFarland, USA",2015,"Jim White moves his family after losing his last job as a football coach, and at his new school he turns seven disappointing students into one of the best cross-country teams in the region. A struggling coach and teacher who has had to move around for different incidents in his career finally comes to one of the poorest cities in America: McFarland, California. There he discovers buried potential in several high school boys and slowly turns them into championship runners and brings them closer than even he could ever imagine. Jim White, a school football coach at odds with the system and players, takes a job as an assistant football coach at McFarland. White finds the potential for cross-country in few students at the school. He gets interested in building up a cross-country team, but has to adjust his ways to suit the system. White and his team overcome poverty and personal turmoil, and get to the pinnacle of success.—Thejus Joseph Jose 1987. Jim White, a high school teacher and football coach, has been fired from one job after another, as the desired end of getting people to do the right thing in his mind has not always justified his sometimes impetuous and spontaneous actions as the means. He, his wife Cheryl White, and their daughters, mid-teen Julie White and preteen Jamie White, have only lived in largely white homogeneous environments, so when Jim accepts the only job he can get as life sciences and phys ed teacher and assistant football coach at McFarland High School in Central California, they are somewhat ill-prepared mentally for the relatively poor conditions and the largely homogeneous Hispanic population in the town, most of their neighbors Mexican immigrants who work as pickers in the surrounding agricultural fields. Within this situation, many of those in the next generation have little chance of getting out of this life, many turning to crime as a means to survive. Regardless, the Whites decide to live in McFarland instead of Jim making the commute from nearby Bakersfield, where most of the school's Caucasian teachers live. While the school's football team is as bad as most that he has coached, the one thing he does notice is that out of necessity many of the boys have the stamina to run long distances quickly. Beyond not respecting Mr. White who they mockingly call Blanco or Homey, the boys see running cross country, a team which Jim wants to establish at McFarland despite he having no history coaching runners, as an activity of the country club set. Jim does whatever he can to get the key boys in any way he can to be the core of the needed seven member team. For them to gel as coach and team members, they will have to understand the other better and fully embrace the opportunities. As the boys manage to reach one goal after another on the march to the state championships, their newfound support as a collective may be threatened by the realities of McFarland and Jim catching the attention of other, more prestigious schools in predominantly white, upper middle class communities.—Huggo Fired for his temper and impatience with brat pupils at several privileged white high schools, Californian P.E. teacher and football coach Jim White must move him family to accept the life sciences and phys ed teacher and assistant football coach post at the poorly reputed school of McFarland, where mots kids are from poor Mexican migrant laborer families, who seem to lack ambition. Training a football team proves wasted effort, but Jim spots some running talent and convinces the principal, by pointing out lucrative state subsidies, to let him set up a track and field team. It takes lots of convincing and nudging to lure boys even to try out, say rather then do detention, but Jim's relentless efforts start paying off, even if he too must learn this new sport on the job. Jim learns how hard Hispanic life is, even does one day of back-breaking picking, and starts binding with their families, who even draw in his own. Champion runner Thomas Valles even starts dating his eldest daughter, the first non-Latino to get a ""quinceanera"", but a bigot attack gravely tests this 'forbidden friendship' between the classes, yet a shot a the state championship is too goof to miss out on.—KGF Vissers",7.4,"$17,000,000 (estimated)","Kevin Costner,Ramiro Rodriguez,Carlos Pratts,Johnny Ortiz,Rafael Martinez,Hector Duran,Sergio Avelar,Michael Aguero,Diana Maria Riva,Omar Leyva,Valente Rodriguez,Danny Mora,Maria Bello,Morgan Saylor,Elsie Fisher,Martha Higareda,Natalia Cordova-Buckley,Ben Hernandez Bray,Vanessa Martinez,Adriana Diaz,Rigo Sanchez,Chris Ellis,Eloy Casados,Josh Clark,Chelsea Rendon,Daniel Moncada,Ashley Bravo,Chad Mountain,J.

330,10. Woman in Gold,2015,"Maria Altmann, an octogenarian Jewish refugee, takes on the Austrian government to recover artwork she believes rightfully belongs to her family. Maria Altmann (Dame Helen Mirren) sought to regain a world famous painting of her aunt plundered by the Nazis during World War II. She did so not just to regain what was rightfully hers, but also to obtain some measure of justice for the death, destruction, and massive art theft perpetrated by the Nazis.—Elyse J. Factor In a series of flashbacks throughout the movie, Maria Altmann (Dame Helen Mirren) recalls the arrival of Nazi forces in Vienna, and the subsequent persecution of the Jewish community and the looting and pillaging conducted by the Nazis against Jewish families. Seeking to escape before the country is completely shut off, Maria Altmann (Tatiana Maslany) and members of her family attempt to flee to the United States. While Altmann and her husband, Fritz (Max Irons), are successful in their escape, she is forced to abandon her parents in Vienna. In the present, living in Los Angeles, a now elderly and widowed Altmann attends the funeral for her sister. She discovers letters in her sister's possession dating to the late 1940s, which reveal an attempt to recover artwork owned by the Bloch-Bauer family that was left behind during the family's flight for freedom and subsequently stolen by the Nazis. Of particular note is a painting of Altmann's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, now known in Austria as the ""Woman in Gold"". A dramatization of the fight by Jewish Maria Altmann née Bloch-Bauer (Dame Helen Mirren), with the help of lawyer E. Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to reclaim items stolen from her family in Austria by the Nazis during World War II, including some paintings by Gustav Klimt, most notably one better known as ""Woman in Gold"" (a painting of Maria's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer) which has been hanging in the Belvedere Museum in Vienna since the end of the war, and which is considered a national Austrian treasure, is presented. A young Maria (Tatiana Maslany) and her husband Fritz Altmann (Max Irons) were able to escape from what was the total Nazi persecution of the Jewish people in Austria during the war eventually to live in Los Angeles. Maria has been unable to reconcile what happened during the war with being a native Austrian, contempt what she feels for Austria and the Austrian peoples. Maria hired young and relatively inexperienced Randy, the grandson of composer Arnold Schönberg, and the son of a family friend, following the death of her older sister Luise, and discovering amongst her possessions that she was planning on taking some form of legal action with the recently instituted Restitution Committee in Austria. Only now getting back on track with his career after some earlier missteps, Randy takes the case solely for the potential financial gain in light of ""Woman in Gold""'s market value. Even then, Randy has to convince his new bosses to allow him to work on this case, which may eventually have high profile, but little chance of success. In Vienna, Maria and Randy find an ally in Viennese investigative journalist Hubertus Czernin (Daniel Brühl), who tells them that the Committee is largely a sham that makes the conditions so prohibitively stringent as for no one being able to succeed. They will also find that the Austrian government generally and the administrators of the Belvedere have no intention of giving up, especially the Klimts, without a fight. Beyond these obstacles, Maria and Randy also have to discover if they do have a legal foot on which to stand regarding whether the paintings rightfully belong to Maria. As Maria and Randy hit one roadblock after another, Randy gains a new appreciation for the case in his affection for Maria and in coming to terms as being a descendant of Holocaust survivors. In Randy discovering alternative legal channels in which to pursue as those at the Belvedere refuse to negotiate, they all know that the Belvedere has one other important factor on their side: that they can drag out whatever legal proceedings as long as need be for elderly Maria to die before any legal decision is made.—Huggo",7.3,"$11,000,000 (estimated)","Helen Mirren,Ryan Reynolds,Daniel Brühl,Katie Holmes,Tatiana Maslany,Max Irons,Charles Dance,Antje Traue,Elizabeth McGovern,Jonathan Pryce,Frances Fisher,Moritz Bleibtreu,Tom Schilling,Allan Corduner,Henry Goodman,Nina Kunzendorf,Alma Hasun,Nellie Schilling,Milica Bogojevic,Justus von Dohnányi,Olivia Silhavy,Ludger Pistor,Ben Miles,Christian Dolezal,Rolf Saxon,Harry Ditson,Stephen Greif,John Moraitis,Doron Davidson,Milly Thomas,Cornelia Ivancan,Dagmar Schwarz,Gideon Singer,Susi Spitz,Anthony Howell,Paul Matic,Asli Bayram,Alexander E.

333,13. Mr. Holmes,2015,"An aged, retired Sherlock Holmes deals with dementia, as he tries to remember his final case, and a mysterious woman, whose memory haunts him. He also befriends a fan, the young son of his housekeeper, who wants him to work again. The story is set in 1947, following a long-retired Holmes living in a Sussex village with his housekeeper and her young son. But then he finds himself haunted by a thirty-year old case. Holmes memory isn't what it used to be, so he only remembers fragments of the case: a confrontation with an angry husband, and a secret bond with his beautiful, but unstable wife. At the end of his life, Holmes finally learns the primacy of love in solving three mysteries involving his last case, his bonds with a young boy and his mother, and a stranger whose life he affected years earlier in a thoughtless recommendation he finally reconciles.—jackiestjoan In 1947, the long-retired Sherlock Holmes, aged ninety-three, lives in a remote Sussex farmhouse with his widowed housekeeper Mrs. Munro and her young son Roger. Having just returned from a trip to Hiroshima, Holmes starts to use jelly made from the prickly ash plant he acquired there to try to improve his failing memory. Unhappy about Watson's fictionalization of his last case, The Adventure of the Dove Grey Glove, he hopes to write his own account, but has trouble recalling the events. As Holmes spends time with Roger, showing him how to take care of the bees in the farmhouse's apiary, he comes to appreciate Roger's curiosity and intelligence and develops a paternal liking for him.",6.8,"$11,000,000 (estimated)","Ian McKellen,Laura Linney,Milo Parker,Hiroyuki Sanada,Hattie Morahan,Patrick Kennedy,Roger Allam,Phil Davis,Frances de la Tour,Charles Maddox,Takako Akashi,Zak Shukor,John Sessions,Michael Culkin,David Foxxe,Oliver Devoti,Mike Burnside,Nicholas Rowe,Sam Coulson,Frances Barber,Hermione Corfield,Kit Connor,Zoë Rainey,Eileen Davies,Colin Starkey,Sarah Crowden,Claire Ashton,Paul Blackwell,Sal Bolton,John Carr,Elizabeth Jane Cassidy,Siong Loong Choong,Gioacchino Jim Cuffaro,John Duggan,Sam Exley,Ben Farrow,Marina Hayter,Tula Howarth,Paul Kerry,Rogers Leona,Robert Lindsell,Devlin Lloyd,Shaun Lucas,Sonia Mason,Siobhán McSweeney,Keith Milner,Shina Shihoko Nagai,Karl Ng,Jason Nicholls,Eitetsu Nozawa,Johnny Otto,Tony Pankhurst,Tom Patrick,Jason Saunders,Linus Scheithauer,Robert Scott,Dean Sills,Clem So,Colin Taylor,Mark Underwood,Nathan Webb,Spike White,Madeleine Worrall",PG,Bill Condon,"Entertainment One,Miramax,Roadside Attractions,Entertainment One,Alamode Film,Ascot Elite Entertainment Group,Captive Cinema Distribution,DeAPlaneta,Dreamwest Pictures,Edko Films,Front Row Filmed Entertainment,InterCom,NOS Audiovisuais,Paradiso Entertainment,Pinema,Seret,Shaw Organisation,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Spentzos Films,United International Pictures (UIP),Videa,Volga,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,KVH Media Group,Lionsgate Home Entertainment,Lionsgate Home Entertainment,Universal Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Nordic,Yleisradio (YLE),ARP Sélection,Gaga,Alamode Film,Alamode Film,Alive Vertrieb und Marketing,Audio Visual Entertainment,Film1,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,BBC Two,SBS,Disney+,SBS Movies","AI-Film,See-Saw Films,BBC Film,FilmNation Entertainment,Archer Gray,Twenty First City,Miramax,Roadside Attractions","Crime,Drama,Family,Mystery,Thriller",104
334,14. The Lazarus Effect,2015,"A group of medical researchers discover a way to bring dead patients back to life. *** SPOILER ALERT *** THE LAZARUS EFFECT follows a group of researchers led by Frank and his fiancée, Zoe, who've achieved the unimaginable - bringing the dead back to life. After a successful, yet unsanctioned, trial on a newly deceased animal, the team is ready to unveil their breakthrough to the world. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is unexpectedly shut down and their materials confiscated. Frank, Zoe and their team take matters into their own hands, launching a rogue attempt to recreate their experiment, during which things go terribly wrong and one of their own, Zoe, is horrifically killed. Fueled by terror and grief, Frank pushes them to do the unthinkable: attempt to resurrect their first human test subject. Initially, the procedure appears a success, but the team soon realizes something is wrong with Zoe. As her strange new persona reveals itself, the team quickly becomes stuck in a gruesome reality. They are no longer faced with the question of whether they can bring someone back to life- but rather, the wrath of her return.—Relativity Dr. Frank Walton and Dr. Zoe McConnell have been researching a serum named ""Lazarus"" to help patients in coma to stay alive during interventions for three years in the university sponsored by the Werner-Goss Biotechnical. They bring the documentarian Eva to make a film about their discoveries with their team formed by Niko and Clay and their experiment with a dead dog. However they discover that Lazarus is capable to resurrect the animal that awakes with a different behavior. They decide to keep their discovery in secret, but their project is shut down by the President Dalley claiming that he had an experiment in direct violation of the Review Board. Further, their research is completely stolen by the Crylonis Pharmaceutical that had become shareholder in Werner-Goss. Frank convinces his team to return to the laboratory to duplicate their experiment to prove that they own the patent of the serum, but there is an accident and Zoe is electrocuted and dies. Frank decides to use the Lazarus to resurrect her against the will of his friends but soon the team learns that something is wrong with Zoe, who is Catholic and tells that she is trapped in hell.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Medical researchers Frank (Mark Duplass) and his fiancee, Zoe (Olivia Wilde), have developed a serum, code-named ""Lazarus"". It was intended to assist coma patients but is shown to actually be able to bring the dead back to life. With the assistance of their friends, Niko (Donald Glover), Clay (Evan Peters), and Eva (Sarah Bolger), they run a successful trial on a recently deceased dog. However, they notice that the dog is behaving differently than it did when it was alive: its cataracts disappear, it loses its appetite, and it demonstrates other strange abilities. Tests reveal that the serum, instead of dissipating, is constructing strange new synapses within the dog's brain. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is shut down. They are also informed that a major pharmaceutical corporation has bought out the company that funded their research. The company and their attorneys confiscate everything associated with the project..",5.2,"$3,300,000 (estimated)","Mark Duplass,Olivia Wilde,Sarah Bolger,Evan Peters,Donald Glover,Ray Wise,Scott Sheldon,Emily Kelavos,James Earl,Amy Aquino,Sean T.

336,16. The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,2015,"As the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has only a single remaining vacancy, posing a rooming predicament for two fresh arrivals, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) pursues his expansionist dream of opening a second hotel. The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is the expansionist dream of Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), and it's making more claims on his time than he has available, considering his imminent marriage to the love of his life, Sunaina (Tina Desai). Sonny has his eye on a promising property now that his first venture, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful, has only a single remaining vacancy, posing a rooming predicament for fresh arrivals Guy Chambers (Richard Gere) and Lavinia Beech (Tamsin Greig). Evelyn Greenslade (Dame Judi Dench) and Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) have now joined the Jaipur workforce, and are wondering where their regular dates for Chilla pancakes will lead, while Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) and Carol Parr (Diana Hardcastle) are negotiating the tricky waters of an exclusive relationship, as Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) juggles two eligible and very wealthy suitors. Perhaps the only one who may know the answers is newly installed co-manager of the hotel, Muriel Donnelly (Dame Maggie Smith), the keeper of everyone's secrets. As the demands of a traditional Indian wedding threaten to engulf them all, an unexpected way forward presents itself.—Fox Searchlight It's been eight months since the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur, India, has been in its current model, with the original British pensioner residents minus Graham (Tom Wilkinson), and Douglas Ainslie's (Bill Nighy's) now estranged wife Jean (Dame Penelope Wilton), still there and immersed in South Asian life for all of its good and bad. In both the good and bad categories, they all, minus Muriel Donnelly (Dame Maggie Smith), are facing emotional issues of the heart in one form or another, which are somewhat affected by their professional commitments. Meanwhile, the hotel is victim of its own success, and as such, the world is seemingly Sonny Kapoor's (Dev Patel's) oyster. He is financially secure enough that he and Sunaina (Tina Desai) can now get married. But he and his business partner Muriel believe they need to expand to a second property, that property which they have chosen and has long been on the market. They are looking for an investor, they believing being a franchise of Evergreen, an American based conglomerate specializing in seniors facilities, the best way to proceed. Evergreen's response is that they will send someone to Jaipur to investigate on their behalf. Sonny is certain the Evergreen representative is an American who checks into the hotel without a reservation, Guy Chambers (Richard Gere), despite Guy stating that he is an aspiring novelist wanting to experience the world for his book. Regardless, Sonny places all of his attention on Guy at the expense of everyone else, especially the other temporary resident of the hotel, Lavinia Beech (Tamsin Greig), a young Brit who is on a reconnaissance trip at the hotel for her mother, and at the expense of his and Sunaina's wedding planning. Sonny's world takes a possible turn for the worse with the arrival back into town of his brother's friend, Kushal (Shazad Latif), as Kushal ends up factoring into Sonny's professional life, as well as is a person who may interest neglected Sunaina romantically. What Sonny is unaware of is that his own actions are a bigger threat to his professional success and future life with Sunaina than Kushal or anybody or anything else. He will also find that eventual heartache is an inherent part of his life in running the hotel in its current model.—Huggo As the contented residents of the hotel begin settling into their new lives, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) strives to balance the demands of planning his wedding with the responsibilities of purchasing a new property. Meanwhile, new guests Guy Chambers (Richard Gere) and Lavinia Beech (Tamsin Greig) find themselves in a predicament after arriving at the hotel to find there is only one vacancy. Perhaps with a little innovation new co-manager Muriel Donnelly (Dame Maggie Smith) can find a means of accommodating the hotel's latest occupants, but she'll have her work cut out for her as Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) and Evelyn Greenslade (Dame Judi Dench) begin their new careers in Jaipur while flirting with the idea of a serious romance, like Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) and Carol Parr (Diana Hardcastle). With romance in the air, it's no wonder that Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) has her pick of handsome suitors, and as stalwart Muriel safeguards the many secrets of the vivacious residents, Sonny and Sunaina learn that planning a traditional Indian wedding can be a true test of commitment. A group of elderly people do everything that they can to adjust to living overseas with each other and new styles.

Kate (Charlotte Rampling) and Geoff Mercer (Sir Tom Courtenay) are planning to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary with dozens of friends. The event is to take place soon in the community hall of Norwich, the town near which they live. A week before the party, Geoff receives a letter which, although he tries to hide it, obviously troubles him. When his wife asks him what is going on, Geoff tells her that the body of Katya, his first great love who disappeared fifty years before in the Alps, has just been found in a melting glacier. From then on, Geoff starts behaving more and more strangely and for the first time after so many years Kate asks herself who the man she married so long ago really is.—Guy Bellinger There is just one week until Kate Mercer's 45th wedding anniversary and the planning for the party is going well. But then a letter arrives for her husband. The body of his first love has been discovered, frozen and preserved in the icy glaciers of the Swiss Alps. By the time the party is upon them, five days later, there may not be a marriage left to celebrate. Married for 45 years, without children, Kate and Geoff Mercer are poised to celebrate their wedding anniversary with a party, when Geoff receives a letter that shakes both of them. The letter, from Switzerland, lets him know that a body has been found: that of Katya, his girlfriend before Kate, who died falling into a fissure in a glacier when the couple were on a walking holiday in 1962. Geoff tells Kate that he was regarded as Katya's next-of-kin, since they had been pretending to be married. Though Kate continues to prepare for the party, and the couple shares some romantic excitement about it, she becomes increasingly disturbed by Geoff's preoccupation with Katya. Geoff begins smoking again; reminisces at length about his carefree time with his previous love; seeks out photographs of her in the attic; and complains bitterly about the way his contemporaries and ex-colleagues have aged. Under Kate's questioning, he states that he would have married Katya had she lived. While Geoff is at a work lunch, Kate searches the attic and finds slides of Katya, which reveal that she was pregnant at the time of her death.

342,22. Life,2015,"A photographer for LIFE Magazine is assigned to shoot pictures of James Dean. This movie chronicles the story behind the 1955 LIFE Magazine photo thread by Dennis Stock of then-rising star, James Dean, and gives us an inside look at some of Hollywood's most iconic images and into the life of a gifted, but troubled man. It's early 1955. Filming on Warner Brothers' East of Eden (1955) has long wrapped, and it will soon be released, with those in key roles doing publicity to promote the movie leading to its New York City premiere. It stars, amongst others, a relative unknown in method actor James Dean in not only his first leading movie role, but his first credited movie role. Casting has begun on the studio's next big title, Rebel Without a Cause, with Dean considered for the lead, which he wants in his overall goal of working solely on quality projects. At an industry party, Dean meets freelance photographer Dennis Stock, who, working largely for Magnum Photos, is trying to build his portfolio to make a name for himself within the business. The two men become friends. Stock is able to convince initially reluctant Dean and Magnum's Executive Editor John G. Morris, who doesn't know Dean from a hole in the wall, to do a series of photos of Dean in the hope of selling them specifically to LIFE Magazine. Stock can see something in Dean, a certain awkwardness in combination with his magnetism, on which he wants to capitalize before the rest of the world clamors to get their hands on him. Despite Dean agreeing to it, the process will not be an easy one for either man as they deal with other issues in their lives, for Dean dealing with a public relationship with Pier Angeli, the two who may view their relationship differently, and navigating the publicity about which he does not fully understand, and for Stock trying to remain a part of his son's life despite his frequent absences. Another key issue is Dean's own internal struggles in wanting a major acting career but not liking, beyond the actual acting, the process to achieve it.—Huggo Before the release of Elia Kazan's East of Eden (1955), James Dean finds himself grappling with anonymity.

Susan Cooper is an unassuming, deskbound CIA analyst--and the unsung hero behind the Agency's most dangerous missions. But when her partner falls off the grid and another top agent is compromised, she volunteers to go deep undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent a global crisis.—20th Century Fox Susan Cooper is a 40-year-old, single, desk-bound CIA employee who remotely assists her partner, field agent Bradley Fine, on a mission. Fine accidentally kills arms dealer Tihomir Boyanov as he sneezes during a confrontation before extracting the location of a suitcase nuke from him. Susan uncovers evidence that Boyanov's daughter Rayna has contacted Sergio De Luca, a suspected broker with ties to various terrorist groups, so Fine infiltrates her home. However, Rayna shoots Fine dead while Susan watches helplessly online, then reveals that she knows the identities of the agency's top agents, including Rick Ford and Karen Walker. Susan, who is almost certainly unknown to Rayna, volunteers to track her (she was a top trainee agent, albeit over 10 years ago). When her boss, Elaine Crocker, reluctantly agrees, the ultra-macho Ford quits in disgust. With her best friend Nancy providing intelligence, Susan goes to Paris undercover. That night, Ford shows up and tells Susan she will fail because of her inexperience. The next morning, Susan discovers that De Luca's office has burned down. She finds a photo of a man standing next to the fire. Ford appears, argues with Susan again and leaves. Susan sees the man in the photo follow him and switch his backpack with another one containing a bomb while Ford is distracted. Susan warns Ford in time during a Verka Serduchka concert, then pursues the man into an abandoned building. During the ensuing fight, he falls to his death.

Brenner is installing a system at the house of Violet Van Patten, who has just divorced, for her son Matty. Out of the blue, he is summoned to the White House and he finds that Violet is a military that works there. Soon he learns that an American base was attacked by aliens. When he meets his friend Ludlow ""The Wonder Kid"" Lamansoff, he discovers that the aliens have found a time capsule sent by the US Government to the space with a videocassette of videogame and understood that it was a declaration of war. The aliens broadcast a challenge to Earth to play and win a videogame against them; otherwise Earth will be destroyed. Now the last hope on Earth is Brenner, Cooper, Ludlow, Violet and Eddie.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war against them, they attack the Earth using games like PAC-MAN, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Centipede and Space Invaders as models for their various assaults. President Will Cooper has to call on his childhood best friend, '80s video game champion Sam Brenner, to lead a team of old-school arcaders to defeat aliens and save the planet: Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) the ""Centipede"" champ, and Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) the ""Donkey Kong"" champ. At a video-game arcade in 1982 with his friend Will Cooper, 13-year-old Sam Brenner discovers he can master the games by spotting patterns. Participating in a video-game championship, he loses in a match with obnoxious arcade player Eddie Plant in Donkey Kong.

376,6. Child 44,2015,"A disgraced member of the Russian military police investigates a series of child murders during the Stalin-era Soviet Union. Based on the first of a trilogy by Tom Rob Smith and set in the Stalin era of the Soviet Union. The plot is about an idealistic pro-Stalin security officer who decides to investigate a series of child murders in a country where supposedly this sort of crime doesn't exist. The state would not hear of the existence of a child murderer let alone a serial killer. He gets demoted and exiled but decides, with just the help of his wife, to continue pursuing the case.—Arnold In 1953 Soviet Russia, the gruesome discovery of a maimed young boy near the railway tracks in Moscow points to an invisible prowler who preys on the innocent.

Under those circumstances, before long, things will take a turn for the worse, when Leo refuses to denounce his schoolteacher wife, Raisa, as a dissident--a bold act of devotion that will condemn the couple to exile, as the death toll keeps rising. However, in a system where distrust is ever-present, what separates an accident from murder?—Nick Riganas A literally flag-bearing member of the Red Army which bloodily crushed Hitler's inner circle last stand in Berlin, war hero Leo Demidov became a blindly loyal member of Stalin's merciless repression police. Having refused to turn on his schoolteacher wife, Raisa, to be denounced as a dissident, he must cease his investigation of suspicious murders on 'missing', probably sexually abused boys, including a mate's son, which Leo refuses to help cover up blindly, as he 'follows' Raisa in exile, transferred to a rural town.

Kate Macer leads a Phoenix based kidnap response unit for the FBI. Following Kate's team leading a raid on a known drug den in nearby Chandler, Kate is recruited to work on a special ops team led by Matt Graver of the CIA, he who is on special assignment for the Department of Defense. They recruited her because they wanted someone with tactical procedures knowledge. Outwardly, the team's mission, which works behind a Delta Force team as its primary gun power as required, is to decapitate a Mexican drug cartel by capturing or dismembering the workings of the main players, cartel head Manuel Díaz, his second in command Guillermo Díaz (Manuel's brother), and drug lord Fausto Alarcón. Kate agrees to the assignment as she feels the work of this team would be more effective in stopping the drug trade in the US than the piecemeal work of her current kidnap response unit. The third on the team is a mysterious Hispanic or Latino man Kate only knows as Alejandro, and who she does not fully trust as she can tell that he is suffering from a very traumatic past. When Kate and the team arrive in El Paso for their first mission, Kate learns that the team's workings are not all they appear on the surface - many of the proceedings which would not be considered above board or legal - despite the end goal being as she knows it to be. Still largely in the dark and only given information on a need to know basis, Kate decides to stick it out with the team if only to discover all that she is not told while still believing in the end goal. She may have changing or at least mixed emotions as she learns more and more about what is going on, including the specific reason why she was recruited.—Huggo FBI field agent Kate Macer is approached to join a special anti-drugs task force that also involves the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice. She is given very little information about the methods or aims of the task force, except that it is going after senior members of a Mexican drug cartel. She soon realizes that their methods are quite unorthodox, even potentially illegal, and the aim may be even more unconventional.—grantss When FBI makes a raid on a cartel house in Arizona, they discover several bodies and two local police officers are killed by a booby trap. The leader of the operation Kate Macer is summoned to a meeting in the Department of Justice and Kate is invited to join a special force commanded by CIA Matt Graver to fight the cartels. The idealistic Kate brings her partner Reggie Wayne and they team up with the force. They learn that the team has the intent to promote havoc in the Sonora Cartel to force one well-known kingpin to come to Mexico to meet the drug lord Fausto Alarcon and find his whereabouts. But soon Kate finds that the assignments led by Matt and Alejandro are absolutely illegal and she discovers why she was invited to join the team.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil An idealistic FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is assigned to work a dangerous stretch of the US-Mexico border by her superior officer (Josh Brolin).

Twenty-two years after the original Jurassic Park failed, the new park, also known as Jurassic World, is open for business. After years of studying genetics, the scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur, the Indominus rex. When everything goes horribly wrong, will our heroes make it off the island?—ahmetkozan Jurassic World has been running with great success for more than a decade in the wake of the disaster that haunted the island twenty-two years ago.

Inside Out,2015,"After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school. Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.—Pixar When a young girl named Riley is uprooted from her Midwestern lifestyle and moves to the busy and chaotic San Francisco, her emotions; Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and (her most important emotion) Joy, start to disagree on how to deal with this dramatic change, which causes problems up in Headquarters, the central living and working place for the five emotions. But, an accident involving Riley's happy memories changes her entire outlook. Joy and Sadness need to find her memories and return them to Headquarters before it's too late. Emotions run wild in the mind of a little girl who is uprooted from her peaceful life in the Midwest and forced to move to San Francisco in this Pixar adventure from director Pete Docter (Up, Monsters Inc.). Young Riley was perfectly content with her life when her father landed a new job in San Francisco, and the family moved across the country. Now, as Riley prepares to navigate a new city and attend a new school, her emotional headquarters becomes a hot bed of activity. As Joy (voice of Amy Poehler) attempts to keep Riley feeling happy and positive about the move, other emotions like Fear (voice of Bill Hader), Anger (voice of Lewis Black), Disgust (voice of Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) make the transition a bit more complicated. Out of the blue, the cheerful eleven-year-old Minnesota girl and hockey aficionado, Riley, finds her world turn upside down, when her parents decide to make a fresh start in San Francisco. As a result, with Riley struggling to cope with the new reality, her young mind's emotional headquarters--where the fundamental feelings of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear reside--are forced to work double time. Now, as the situation spirals out of control, and desperate Joy tries her best to troubleshoot the unprecedented problem, something starts to happen in Riley's core memory sector.

He is divorcing from his wife Emma that intends to move in together with her wealthy boyfriend Daniel Riddick. Meanwhile the researchers Dr. Lawrence Hayes and Dr. Kim Park from the Caltech travel to a dam to check their seismic studies and there is a strong earthquake collapsing the dam. Lawrence discovers that the San Andreas Fault is moving and will cause a huge earthquake in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Ray needs to travel to help the victims from the dam and Daniel offers to take Blake to San Francisco since he has a meeting in the city.

Picking up his ex Emma, Gaines abandons his duty to search for Blake, even after her cellphone breaking down suggests her probably already being buried. Luckily for her, she was saved from the subterranean car parking of duly fleeing Riddicks's HQ by applying British architect Ben Taylor, who has a crush on her, encouraged as in all by his dashing kid brother Ollie, so the trio heads for higher ground despite the dim chances of rescue and the likelihood of further collapses, unaware there rescue is on its way.—KGF Vissers",6.1,"$110,000,000 (estimated)","Dwayne Johnson,Carla Gugino,Alexandra Daddario,Ioan Gruffudd,Archie Panjabi,Paul Giamatti,Hugo Johnstone-Burt,Art Parkinson,Will Yun Lee,Kylie Minogue,Colton Haynes,Todd Williams,Matt Gerald,Alec Utgoff,Marissa Neitling,Morgan Griffin,Breanne Hill,Laurence Coy,Fiona Press,Dennis Coard,Ben McIvor,Nick Allen-Ducat,Claire Lovering,Sophia Emberson-Bain,Julian Shaw,Sofie Formica,Hugh Francis,Brad McMurray,John Reynolds,Simone Kessell,Saskia Williscroft,Arabella Morton,Hayley Sullivan,Renee Somerfield,Joey Vieira,Benjamin Blankenship,Barry Southgate,Nikki Green,Calum Grant,E.

402,7. The Lobster,2015,"In a dystopian near future, according to the laws of The City, single people are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in 45 days or they're transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods. A love story set in a dystopian near future where single people are arrested and transferred to a creepy hotel. There they are obliged to find a matching mate in 45 days. If they fail, they are transformed into an animal and released into the woods.—R. Byma Set in a dystopian, future, single people are sent to a hotel where they must find a partner in 45 days or get turned into a wild animal of their choice. David's wife has just left him, after 11 years of marriage, and he is sent the hotel. His chosen animal, should he not find a partner, is a lobster.—grantss In a dystopian society, David, whose wife has just left him, is sent to the hotel for singles in the country. The strict hotel rules are meant, in a clinical fashion, to foster love, as everyone in this society, straight or gay, is to be paired up romantically. There are harsh punishments for anyone breaking the rules. And like the others, if David does not find love at the hotel within forty-five days, he will be surgically transformed into the animal of his own choice - David's being a lobster - this transformation not meant to be a punishment but rather another opportunity to find love as another species. Bob, the dog that David brings to the hotel, was in fact David's brother in his human life. David will discover that his search for love is dependent on the other people at the hotel, each who has his or her own agenda in what to do if true love cannot be found within their time limit. Unaware of it upon his arrival at the hotel, David will also learn that there are a bunch of anarchists who live in the woods, many of those being escapees from the hotel. The anarchists do not tolerate coupling in any form within their group, except as a ruse whenever they need to assimilate themselves into city life. But as one cannot automatically turn on the emotional taps to find true love at the hotel, one cannot automatically turn those taps off if being among the anarchists.—Huggo In a bleak dystopia where finding love is a matter of survival, just forty-five days can make all the difference between solitary despair and transformation. For those who are chronically unattached or recently single, the pressure is on: they must embrace their inner selves or risk becoming prey. As David, a freshly heartbroken architect, arrives at the opulent Hotel, a rehabilitation sanctuary, he, too, must face an unsettling ultimatum: find a compatible mate or meet his fate in the unforgiving wild. But in this complex world, new rules take hold, suppressing rebellious individuals who choose personal freedom over the confines of serious commitment. Now, haunting questions demand answers. Can genuine love break through the defences of a community dedicated to self-imposed isolation? Will the longing for connection triumph in a place designed to crush hope?—Nick Riganas",7.1,"EUR4,000,000 (estimated)","Jacqueline Abrahams,Roger Ashton-Griffiths,Jessica Barden,Olivia Colman,Anthony Dougall,Seán Duggan,Colin Farrell,Roland Ferrandi,James Finnegan,Robert Heaney,Rosanna Hoult,Jaro,Ryac,Ashley Jensen,Kathy Kelly,Ariane Labed,Ewen MacIntosh,Patrick Malone,Sandra Hayden Mason,Kevin McCormack,Ishmael Moalosi,Anthony Moriarty,Garry Mountaine,Judi King Murphy,Laoise Murphy,Imelda Nagle Ryan,Nancy Onu,Matthew O'Brien,EmmaEdel O'Shea,Angeliki Papoulia,John C.

When they appease the son, he then says he has issues with Vince. So as they try to fix the situation, Ari's catching heat both professionally and personally. And Vincent's friend, E who is expecting a baby with his ex Sloane, is trying to decide if he wants to get back with her.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Vincent Chase, who separated from his wife after nine days of marriage, wants to do something new in his career. He calls his former agent-turned-studio head Ari Gold, who offers Vince a leading role in his first studio production. Vince says he will only star in it if he directs. Eight months later, Hyde, the directorial debut by Vince, is in the middle of post-production and is over budget by $15 million. Needing more money, Vince asks Ari if they can get an additional $10 million to complete the movie. Reluctant, but wanting to please him, Ari flies to Texas to meet the co-financiers of the movie, Larsen McCredle and his son Travis, to get them to give the money. Hesitant, Larsen sends Travis with Ari back to Los Angeles to see a cut of the film at Vince's private screening. Vince has second thoughts on the rough cut and cancels the screening out of fear no one will enjoy it. He later gives Ari and Travis a copy of the movie for their viewing. Ari and Travis enjoy the movie but Travis requests that Ari cut the scenes with Vince's brother, Johnny ""Drama"" Chase, out of the movie or he will not give the film the extra money. With Ari giving him no answer, Travis puts the post-production on hold. Vince and Eric ""E"" Murphy visit Travis to come up with a solution, but this results in Travis saying he did not like Vince's performance either and wants the entire movie to be redone with a new lead and director. In addition, studio CEO John Ellis removes Ari from the production..",6.5,"$30,000,000 (estimated)","Kevin Connolly,Adrian Grenier,Kevin Dillon,Jerry Ferrara,Jeremy Piven,Emmanuelle Chriqui,Perrey Reeves,Rex Lee,Debi Mazar,Rhys Coiro,Constance Zimmer,Haley Joel Osment,Ronda Rousey,Kid Cudi,Alan Dale,Emily Ratajkowski,Billy Bob Thornton,Nina Agdal,Lucas Ellin,Piers Morgan,Rocky,Mark Cuban,Sabina Gadecki,Thierry Henry,Max Ellin,Jennie Kwan,Tip 'T.I.'

408,13. Youth,2015,"Retired orchestra conductor Fred Ballinger is on vacation with his daughter Lena and his film director best friend Mick Boyle in the Alps when he receives an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II to perform for Prince Philip's birthday. Fred and Mick, two old friends, are on vacation in an elegant hotel at the foot of the Alps. Fred, a composer and conductor, is now retired. Mick, a movie director, is still working. They look with curiosity and tenderness on their children's confused lives, Mick's enthusiastic young writers, and the other hotel guests. While Mick scrambles to finish the screenplay for what he imagines will be his last important movie, Fred has no intention of resuming his musical career. But someone wants at all costs to hear him conduct again.—Anonymous Love Revolver Octogenarians Fred Ballinger and Mick Boyle have been friends for sixty years, are in-laws - Fred's daughter Lena and Mick's son Julian who are married to each other - and are currently staying at the same hotel resort in Wiesen, Switzerland, it a regular getaway for Fred and where he used to come with his wife, Melanie, who now lives in nearby Venice. While filmmaker Mick is there with the screenwriting team of his latest movie - what he is calling his testament - it a retreat to complete the treatment, most specifically the screenplay's final scene, Fred, a retired songwriter/composer and maestro, is there primarily for some medical tests while he otherwise relaxes. Lena, his personal assistant, is also there, albeit longer than she was planning, somewhat as Fred has been asked to come out of retirement for a special concert to conduct a performance of arguably his most famous song cycle, called The Simple Songs, made famous by Melanie, this concert which he is hesitant to do. One other common bond between the two friends is each having a failed marriage, and their youthful infatuations with the same girl, Gilda Black, about who they still talk. There are a few other notables at the resort, some with who they interact, while others they merely observe. They include: Jimmy Tree, a famous actor who laments being known for his schlock rather than for his more unknown serious work; a former South American athlete with health issues of his own, he who may be known as much for his star making plays as he is for a more infamous one; and Miss Universe. The interactions between this collective, especially between the two friends, leads to each entering into a process of self-discovery, the future for each which is different depending on where he/she currently is in life.—Huggo Wiling away at a luxurious resort in the Swiss Alps, the retired silver-haired composer, Fred Ballinger, soaks in lazy ennui and indolence, until an emissary for Queen Elizabeth II approaches him, asking him to perform one of his early compositions at Prince Philip's birthday. However, as the legendary musician and his equally successful filmmaker friend, Mick, ponder on life's brevity; the inevitability of death; the suffocating absolutism of youth, and the perpetual adoration of beauty, a decision must be made.

Bully prison warden Bill Boss, leading a big state prison in the US of A, has a lot of problems; his prison statistically has the highest amount of prison riots, medical costs and staff turnover in the country. But foremost he is unable to get the respect he thinks he deserves from his inmates and the state Governor. He constantly fails in experimenting with different ideas for the ideal punishment to get the inmates in line, which drives him, together with the sizzling heat, completely insane. Under threats of termination by the Governor, his loyal right hand man Dwight comes up with a brilliant idea. A revolutionary idea which could change the American prison system for good and save billions of dollars.

A celebrated military contractor returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs - the US Space program in Honolulu, Hawaii - and reconnects with a long-ago love while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watchdog assigned to him.—Sony Pictures Entertainment In this era of private sector billionaires taking over much of the work in space from governments, Brian Gilcrest left the US Air Force to work for one of those billionaires, Carson Welch. However, incidents in Afghanistan including injuries while working for Carson have left Brian on the outside looking in, he now taking any scraps of work even remotely related to space. It is one of those jobs that takes him back to Hawaii, his old stomping grounds. That job is to organize a traditional Hawaiian blessing for a pedestrian gate Carson is building in association with a rocket launch facility, Brian's responsibilities including negotiating with the native islanders for their participation. To ensure things go smoothly, the Air Force, who have negotiated a separate deal with Carson for him to launch a satellite to improve such things as wireless services, has assigned Captain Allison Ng, a space geek and one-quarter native islander, to be Brian's ""shadow"" for his entire stay in Hawaii. Brian's return to Hawaii is bittersweet in being reunited with his old girlfriend, Tracy, who he has not seen in thirteen years when Brian left Hawaii, she now married to one of Brian's old colleagues, John Woodside - Woody - the two who have two children. Regardless of the sparks of both a positive and negative kind that still exist between Tracy and Brian, there is trouble in the Woodside marriage largely due to Woody's unusual means of communication, which Tracy sees as no communication whatsoever. As Brian goes through his work, he and Allison start to fall for each other, in part due to their shared love of space and island life. Things have the potential to go off the rails with Brian's job and his burgeoning relationship with Allison when Carson's true long game comes to light within certain small circles, the issue being who knew of that long game and if they did anything either to support or thwart it.—Huggo A former US Air Force officer, Brian Gilchrist, returns to Hawaii as a civilian contractor. He now works for a private space company, owned by multi-billionaire Carson Welch.

However, the woman is Dora, who lives alone with her sister Imma, and both are old and ugly women. What can Dora do to avoid the King's harassment? In another Kingdom, the King raises a giant flea and his daughter Violet that is reaching the age of getting married.

A new philosophy professor arrives on a small town campus near Newport, Rhode Island. His name, Abe Lucas. His reputation : bad. Abe is said to be a womanizer and an alcoholic. But what people do not know is that he is a disillusioned idealist. Since he has become aware of his inability to change the world, he has indeed been living in a state of deep nihilism and arrogant desperation. In class, he only goes through the motions and outside he drinks too much. But as far as sex is concerned, he is just a shadow of himself now: depression is not synonymous with Viagra! For all that, he can't help being attracted to one of his students, pretty and bright Jill Pollard. He enters into a relationship with her which remains platonic, even if Jill would not say no to more. The situation remains unchanged for a while until, one day, in a diner, Abe and Jill surprise a conversation that will change the course of their lives dramatically...—Guy Bellinger The Philosophy Department of Braylin College in Rhode Island is about to welcome its newest lecturer, and the stories surrounding him are already legend.

His reputation as a womanizer and loner genius precedes him.

He is only one step before thoughts of committing suicide, he having romanticized the notion of death. He, as a person, is, however, still able to attract people to himself sexually, two women at Braylin who make their interest known to him. The first is Chemistry professor Rita Richards, who is dissatisfied with her marriage. The second is Jill Pollard, one of his students who is already in a committed relationship with Roy, a fellow student. While Abe does succumb to Rita's advances however unsuccessfully, he is careful to keep his relationship with Jill as a platonic one, despite Jill's feelings for him being what, at her tender age, she may consider true love. While out with Jill, Abe stumbles upon thoughts of an act of existentialism.

Barney Thomson (Robert Carlyle) is a sad sack of a man. He identifies himself mostly as a barber, Hendersons' Barbers in a working class neighborhood of Glasgow, Scotland, where he's worked for twenty years. More introspective than extroverted, which does not work well for the business, he has fewer and fewer customers, and as such his current boss, Wullie Henderson (Stephen McCole), son of the retired owner James Henderson (James Cosmo), who originally hired him, is moving him further and further away from the spotlight of the shop. Meanwhile, five men so far have been killed by who the general public is nicknaming the ""Body Parts Killer,"" as the murderer sends through the post body parts of the victims to the victims' loved ones. Lead investigator, Detective Inspector Holdall (Ray Winstone), assisted by Detective Inspector Callum MacPherson (Kevin Guthrie), is no closer now to discovering the Body Parts Killer's identity than when the murders started two months ago. Wanting results, Chief Superintendent McManaman (Sir Tom Courtenay) takes Holdall and MacPherson off the case, instead assigning it to Detective Inspector June Robertson (Ashley Jensen), an A-type personality who believes she can do no wrong, and will take credit for others doing right, which places her and Holdall at odds with each other. What were so far these two unrelated paths start to merge when Wullie tells Barney that he is giving his chair to a new barber, effectively firing him. In an ensuing altercation of sorts, Barney accidentally kills Wullie. When Wullie is reported as missing, Holdall and MacPherson are sent to investigate, and increasingly believe that Barney not only killed Wullie, whose body has not been discovered, but that he is the Body Parts Killer, both which Robertson believes are nonsense. The matter gets more complicated when Barney's self-absorbed, chain smoking and dispassionate mother, Cemolina (Dame Emma Thompson), gets involved, she who would never be considered Mother of the Year.—Huggo",6.2,N/A,"Robert Carlyle,Emma Thompson,Ray Winstone,Tom Courtenay,Ashley Jensen,Brian Pettifer,Kevin Guthrie,James Cosmo,Stephen McCole,Martin Compston,Samuel Robertson,Anne Downie,Ann Scott-Jones,Eileen McCallum,Matt Costello,Barbara Rafferty,David McGowan,Finlay Welsh,Sarah McCardie,Skye Cooper Barr,Ruari Cannon,Dolina MacLennan,Jamie Merritt,Scott Dymond,Lee Fanning,Joe Szula,James Casey,Scott Woods,Penny Lamb,Mark Barrett,Jay Hunter,Ross Miller,Peter Adams,Matthew Baxter,Paul Ellard,Gareth McInally,Nicola Roy,David Speed",Unrated,Robert Carlyle,"Aya Pro,Icon Film Distribution,Blue Swan Entertainment,Eagle Films,Gravitas Ventures,Icon Home Entertainment,L'Atelier d'Images,Pacific Northwest Pictures,Pinnacle Films,Selecta Visión,Selecta Visión,Universal Pictures,Universal Pictures","Trinity Works Entertainment,Sigma Films,Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit,Creative Scotland,Icon Film Distribution,Movie Central,Myriad Pictures,Province of British Columbia,The Movie Network,Téléfilm Canada,Westerkick Capital","Comedy,Crime",96

Despite having a love/hate relationship with her scoundrel of a father Gordon Townsend, the one thing Amy Townsend has grown up believing from him is that monogamy isn't realistic; he and Amy's mom broke up because of infidelity when Amy was young. As such, she gets drunk and stoned frequently in her pursuit of indiscriminate sex, with an unstated rule that there is no sleeping over once the sex is over.

But all is not as it seems when he starts to uncover the mystery of the body's origin and the organization that will kill to protect its cause.—Anonymous Without a single doubt, time is running out for New York's powerful and successful real-estate magnate, Damian Hale. Battling terminal cancer, the dying billionaire will get a new lease on life, when the shady Phoenix BioGenetic organisation's cutting-edge ""Shedding"" procedure offers the choice to start afresh, in a vigorous young body. However, as Damian's consciousness settles in a pristine new host, strange hallucinations of a borrowed life will be the first set of unforeseen drawbacks.

The one person he wants to reconnect with before he dies is his estranged daughter, Claire Hale, who refuses to speak to him.

The procedure would entail that Damian give up his life as he knows it, but with what money he is able to stash away, to start life anew in a newly created identity, in his case thirty-five year old Phoenix born Edward Kidner. Part of the recovery is to take medication contained in a red capsule on a daily basis. In missing one dose, ""Edward"", during his recovery away from the secret and hidden facility, begins to see visions of people and places he doesn't know, but knows something about, and inherently knows exist in real life. In tracking down the people and places in his vision hopefully without Albright or his subordinates knowing, Edward begins to believe that his life under Albright's world will never be his own. In the process, he has to figure out exactly what those red capsules he takes every day actually do, which again he surmises is not exactly what Albright tells him, and how to regain a life he can call his own while also protecting/saving those Albright sees as acceptable collateral damage in unknowingly getting Damian to this point as Edward.—Huggo",6.5,"$26,000,000 (estimated)","Ryan Reynolds,Natalie Martinez,Matthew Goode,Ben Kingsley,Victor Garber,Derek Luke,Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen,Melora Hardin,Michelle Dockery,Sam Page,Brendan McCarthy,Thomas Francis Murphy,Sandra Ellis Lafferty,Emily Tremaine,Griff Furst,Cedric Palmisano,Tom Waite,Douglas M.

472,2. The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,2015,"In the early 1960s, CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB operative Illya Kuryakin participate in a joint mission against a mysterious criminal organization, which is working to proliferate nuclear weapons. In the 1960s with the Cold War in play, CIA agent Napoleon Solo successfully helps Gaby Teller defect to West Germany despite the intimidating opposition of KGB agent Illya Kuryakin. Later, all three unexpectedly find themselves working together in a joint mission to stop a private criminal organization from using Gaby's father's scientific expertise to construct their own nuclear bomb. Through clenched teeth and stylish poise, all three must find a way to cooperate for the sake of world peace, even as they each pursue their own agendas.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In the 60's, the CIA agent Napoleon Solo is assigned to bring the mechanic Gaby Teller from East Berlin to the other side of the wall. Gaby is the daughter of the scientist and American collaborator Udo Teller that defected from German at the end of WWII and now has vanished. They are chased by KGB agent Illya Kuryakin but they succeed to escape. Soon Napoleon Solo's chief Saunders discloses that Gaby's uncle Rudi works for the wealthy Alexander and his wife Victoria Vinciguerra and Udo might be secretly building a nuclear weapon for them. Napoleon Solo is forced to team-up with Illya and Gaby and they go to Rome to investigate.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1963, the height of the Cold War. In an unlikely alliance, a CIA agent, Napoleon Solo and KGB agent, Illya Kuryakin, band together to save the world from nuclear disaster. A top nuclear scientist, formerly employed by the US, has gone missing. It is suspected his brother has kidnapped him to work on a nuclear bomb. Solo and Kuryakin accompany the scientist's daughter, Gaby, to Rome, as this is where her uncle is based. The idea is to covertly investigate his company and, hopefully, find the scientist and the bomb. Things aren't all plain sailing though. This is heightened by the fact that Solo and Kuryakin aren't sure they can trust each other and, to some extent, still regard each other as enemies.—grantss 1963. Napoleon Solo is a suave and urbane C.I.A. agent. He was once a criminal, but the C.I.A. believed his unique talents would be of better service to the country as a spy than they would be if he was behind bars. His current case is to locate Dr. Udo Teller, a famed German rocket scientist who had been working for the Americans on their nuclear program since the end of WWII until he disappeared without a trace two years ago, that is until he was recently photographed in Rome. Napoleon manages to smuggle Teller's biological daughter, Gaby Schmidt, out of East Berlin to the west in order to locate Teller. The Americans don't believe she knows anything about his whereabouts - her father who she has not seen or heard from in eighteen years - but that she can influence some who do, namely her Uncle Rudi who is an executive at Rome-based Vinciguerra Shipping, owned and operated by husband and wife Alexander and Victoria Vinceguerra. The company is purportedly the front for the development of nuclear weapons, the major national intelligence agencies suspecting that Victoria, the brains behind the operation, having kidnapped Teller to build her an atom bomb. Because of the global implications, Napoleon is forced to work on this case with KGB agent Illya Kuryakin. Beyond the east-west divide between the Americans and Soviets, Napoleon will have a difficult time working with his new partner due to their recent not so pleasant encounter in East Berlin, and Illya's volatile and violent temper, which can cloud what he does professionally. As Napoleon, Illya and Gaby work on the case - their success or failure which may determine world order - what happens is affected by other players in the picture which they do not know about, and the Americans and Soviets working arguably on their own different agendas.—Huggo",7.2,"$75,000,000 (estimated)","Henry Cavill,Armie Hammer,Alicia Vikander,Elizabeth Debicki,Luca Calvani,Sylvester Groth,Hugh Grant,Jared Harris,Christian Berkel,Misha Kuznetsov,Guy Williams,Marianna Di Martino,Julian M.

482,12. The 33,2015,"Based on the real-life event, when a gold and copper mine collapses, it traps 33 miners underground for 69 days. A docudramatic account of the 2010 Chilean mine disaster is presented, where the thirty-three miners who went into the San José Mine in Copiapó, Chile in the middle of the Atacama Desert on August 5 were trapped 700 meters underground for sixty-nine days, with all thirty-three eventually able to make it out of the mine alive. That day, mine foreman, Luis ""Don Lucho"" Urzúa, reported his concerns to mine owner, Carlos Castillo, about the unstable nature of the mountain under which the mine is located, those concerns which went unheeded. Don Lucho one of the thirty-three, went to work as usual into the mine, when that instability led to collapse in some of the underground shafts, the thirty-three who were able to make it to the refuge area, however with communication channels to the surface inoperable. Under normal circumstances, the refuge area had enough supplies to last thirty men three days. The miners also discovered that the company had failed to place the requisite ladders from the refuge area to the surface, and that the primary route out was now blocked by a shifted rock, its mass the equivalent of the Empire State Building. The thirty-three were ultimately led by Mario Sepúlveda, who was not going to let any of the thirty-three take priority over any of the others, especially in the initial panic and instinct for self-survival among some. On the surface, loved ones of the trapped miners held vigil at the mine, with María Segovia, elder sister of trapped miner Dario Segovia, arguably the most outspoken in condemnation of the powers that be not doing anything to search for the miners, not knowing if they were dead or alive, but who was also quick to give praise where praise was due. That praise largely went to the relatively new Minister of Mines, Laurence Golborne, who was determined both to do whatever he could on behalf of the government to look for the men and to provide accurate assessments to those holding vigil of the situation, especially in Castillo seeing miner deaths solely as an unfortunate nature of the business. The chief engineer assigned to drill toward the refuge area in the hopes that the miners were there was Andre Sougarret, who admitted that the process was not a scientific one as one would have hoped. Once the miners were discovered alive in the refuge area, the next phase of trying to extract them held its own new challenges for all concerned, both logistical and emotional.—Huggo Dozens of people from Copiapó, Chile, work in the San José mine. The owner ignores the warnings of the failing stability of the mine, which collapses a short time later. The only path inside the mine is completely blocked, and the thirty-three miners manage to get to the rescue chamber. They discover that the radio is useless, the medical kit is empty, the ventilation shafts lack the required ladders, and there is very little stored food. Mario Sepúlveda becomes the leader of the miners, dividing the foods rations and stopping the outbursts of violence and despair. The mine company does not attempt any rescue, and the relatives of the miners gather around the gates. August 5, 2010. As the small copper-and-gold San José mine collapses, trapping 33 men 700 metres underground, the entire world focuses on Copiapó, Chile. In the following 69 days after the devastating cave-in, an international rescue team tirelessly works day and night to save the trapped miners, as the families and friends of the doomed crew can only pray for a miracle. This is the story of Mario Sepúlveda and his enclosed companions, who, against all odds, had to endure sweltering heat, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion to survive in a desperate race against time.—Nick Riganas",6.9,"$26,000,000 (estimated)","Antonio Banderas,Rodrigo Santoro,Juliette Binoche,James Brolin,Lou Diamond Phillips,Mario Casas,Jacob Vargas,Juan Pablo Raba,Oscar Nuñez,Tenoch Huerta,Marco Treviño,Adriana Barraza,Kate del Castillo,Cote de Pablo,Elizabeth De Razzo,Naomi Scott,Gustavo Angarita,Alejandro Goic,Bob Gunton,Gabriel Byrne,Raoul Pinno,Mario Zaragoza,Paulina García,Cristián Campos,Jorge Diaz,Juan Pablo Auger,Leonardo Farkas,Francisca Concha,Diego Noguera,Sebastián Apiolaza,Jorge Godoy,Marcelo Gutiérrez,Carlos Talamilla,Trinidad González,Fernanda Ramírez,Orlando Alfaro,Felipe Álvarez,Ignacio De Vries,Luis Alberto Aracena,Henry Bravo,Jaime Correa,Juan Carlos Solarte,William Winston,Santiago Carreño,Ariel Sierra,Nicolas Troya,Nando Monge,Fredy Yate,Pedro Calvo,Jonatan Gómez,Edgardo Petliuk,Elbert Galeano,Juan Saldarriaga,Luis Hernando Rodríguez,Daniel Ospina,Hedras Urrego,David Quintero,Franklin Miguel Gutierrez Mora,Fernando Rojas,Henry Ortiz,Erik Rodriguez,Edwart Silva,Fernando Esterilla,Karolina González,Ángela García,Daian Parra,Sojana Ortiz,Lore Garcia E,Rosa Garavito,Monserrat Álvarez,Alexis Catepanopolus,Tim Willcox,Anderson Cooper,Michel Floquet,Salma Al Jamal,Habib Ghribi,Don Francisco,Brian Alvarez,Hernan Belair,Luis Vitalino Grandón,Fuentealba Rodrigo,Tim Wilcox",PG-13,Patricia Riggen,"GEM Entertainment,20th Century Fox Argentina,9ers Entertainment,ACME,ACME,ACME,Alcon Entertainment,Geo Films,Golden Village Pictures,InterCom,Kings Creative Media,Kinomania,Pris Audiovisuais,Telecine,Twentieth Century Fox,Warner Bros.

But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet.

All alone on a lifeless rock--140 million miles away from Earth, and in the face of limited resources--the stranded astronaut must do everything in his power to survive, as unexpected satellite photos prove that Mark is still alive.

498,3. Spotlight,2015,"The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. When the Boston Globe's tenacious ""Spotlight"" team of reporters delves into allegations of abuse in the Catholic Church, their year-long investigation uncovers a decades-long cover-up at the highest levels of Boston's religious, legal, and government establishment, touching off a wave of revelations around the world.—Open Road In existence since the 1970s, Spotlight is the investigative reporting unit of the Boston Globe. They can spend months or years on a single story, which they choose amongst themselves. As such, they are somewhat autonomous from the rest of the newspaper, only needing to report to their superior. As a rule, they are not to discuss their work with anyone else, whether it be other staff, friends and or family. In 2001, the four person team consisted of its editor Walter Robinson - Robby to his friends - and his team of three investigative journalists, Michael Rezendes, Sacha Pfeiffer and Matt Carroll. Robby reports to the assistant managing editor, Ben Bradlee Jr.. Upon his arrival from his most recent position in Florida, Marty Baron, the newly appointed editor-in-chief. Mr. Baron requests Spotlight to place their current project on hold and dig deeper into a recent story written by fellow Globe reporter and columnist Eileen McNamara, regarding allegations against a Catholic priest of sexual abuse of a minor and what appears to be the subsequent cover-up by the head of the Archdiocese of Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law. They are at first hesitant to work on the story, seeing Baron as an outsider to Boston, he who doesn't understand what is important to locals. Baron's outsider status includes not being born and raised there, and not being Catholic (he being the Globe's first Jewish editor-in-chief). Spotlights first task is to see if they can get some court documents on the case unsealed, which means they will need a court order. The Church and its parishioners could falsely interpret this as The Globe suing the Catholic church. This could have major, negative consequences for The Globe due to the fact that a majority of their subscribers are Catholic. Robby and his team begin by speaking to lawyers who have or are working on alleged sexual abuse cases perpetrated by Catholic priests in and immediately surrounding Boston (those lawyers said including Eric MacLeish and Mitchell Garabedian), known victims (such as Phil Saviano, the head of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP)) and insiders in the Catholic church. Through this investigation, they get wind that the problem is not contained to a couple of priests and few victims, in essence changing the focus from the priest(s) to the systemic problem of the Archdiocese not only covering up the abuse but in reality doing nothing to stop it and thus condoning it. Their goal is not only the end product of an important story, but making sure that the other major local newspapers, such as the Boston Herald, do not beat them to the scant outline of the story in the public consciousness which the Catholic church could easily quash. Through it all, they may come to some unpleasant realizations that not only the Archdiocese and the Catholic church in general are to blame for what happened.—Huggo In 2001, editor Marty Baron of The Boston Globe assigns a team of journalists to investigate allegations against John Geoghan, an unfrocked priest accused of molesting more than 80 boys. Led by editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, reporters Michael Rezendes, Matt Carroll and Sacha Pfeiffer interview victims and try to unseal sensitive documents. The reporters make it their mission to provide proof of a cover-up of sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church.—Jwelch5742 The true story of how, in 2001, reporters at the Boston Globe investigated accusations of Catholic priests in Boston molesting children. Following on from leads, interviews with victims, existing court cases and extensive research they reveal decades of abuse. They discover that the issue was far wider spread than they at first believed, that senior members of the diocese were aware of the issue and that the church systemically covered up the crimes.—grantss",8.1,"$20,000,000 (estimated)","Mark Ruffalo,Michael Keaton,Rachel McAdams,Liev Schreiber,John Slattery,Brian d'Arcy James,Stanley Tucci,Elena Wohl,Gene Amoroso,Doug Murray,Sharon McFarlane,Jamey Sheridan,Neal Huff,Billy Crudup,Robert B.

499,4. Black Mass,2015,"The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf. In late-1970s Boston, the FBI are looking to break the Mafia's hold on the north of the city. Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) is on the case and willing to go to any lengths to achieve his aims. A South Boston native, he decides to ""ally"" the FBI with South Boston crime kingpin James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp), as his main enemies are the Mafia. Approaching Bulger via his brother Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), a Massachusetts State Senator, Connolly is successful in gaining Bulger as an informant and ally against the Mafia. However, this alliance only emboldens Bulger in his quest for power and wealth, as he is able to operate with impunity and utter ruthlessness. Not realizing he is being duped, Connolly finds himself backing Bulger rather than law, order, and justice.—grantss In the 1970s, Irish criminal James ""Whitey"" Bulger is the leader of the Winter Hill Gang in South Boston after imprisonments for many years. His brother William ""Billy"" Bulger is a Massachusetts Senator. When ambitious FBI agent John Connolly is assigned to investigate the Boston Mafia, he proposes a deal to Whitey, his childhood friend, to become an FBI informant; in return, the FBI would neglect any investigation of his gang. They take down the Italian mob with Whitey's information while Whitey becomes one of the most powerful and notorious gangsters in South Boston. But when the prosecutor Fred Wyshak is assigned to Boston, he demands investigation of Whitey despite the interference of Connolly and Whitey becomes one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A partial account of the life of 'James 'Whitey Bulger is presented. This phase of his story begins in 1975 when his gangster activities are largely confined to the South Boston neighborhood where he grew up, there where his group, the Winter Hill Gang, are the kingpins of such criminal activity. John Connolly, an FBI agent recently returned to Boston and a childhood friend of Whitey's state-senator brother Billy Bulger, approaches Whitey with a proposal: to act as his snitch against other Boston mobsters, most specifically the Angiulos of North Boston, in return for protection against any FBI action against himself, with only a handful of people within the Bureau in the know. Although reluctant at first in not wanting to be caught or thus identified as an informer, Whitey eventually agrees following a specific incident. The effect of their agreement on their professional and personal lives over the next twenty years is presented, as Whitey's criminal empire is allowed to flourish with the unfettered elimination of his competition, as Whitey does whatever he wants without FBI retribution to protect his own interests, and as those in the know within the FBI question whether Whitey has been of any real use to them.—Huggo",6.8,"$65,000,000 (estimated)","Johnny Depp,Joel Edgerton,Benedict Cumberbatch,Dakota Johnson,Kevin Bacon,Peter Sarsgaard,Jesse Plemons,Rory Cochrane,David Harbour,Adam Scott,Corey Stoll,Julianne Nicholson,W.

501,6. Everest,2015,"On May 10, 1996, mountain guides Rob Hall and Scott Fischer combine their expedition teams for a final ascent to the summit of Mount Everest. With little warning, a storm strikes the mountain and the climbers must now battle to survive. On the morning of May 10, 1996, climbers from two commercial expeditions start their final ascent toward the summit of Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. With little warning, a violent storm strikes the mountain, engulfing the adventurers in one of the fiercest blizzards ever encountered by man. Challenged by the harshest conditions imaginable, the teams must endure blistering winds and freezing temperatures in an epic battle to survive against nearly impossible odds. Back in 1992, New Zealand's intrepid mountaineer, Robert ""Rob"" Edwin Hall, started guiding amateur climbers on Mount Everest. With his company named ""Adventure Consultants"", he successfully led 19 clients to the summit without a single fatality--and his 1996 Everest expedition, which consisted of eight clients and three guides--was the perfect example about the increasing demand for expeditions to the Everest. As a result, on 11 May 1996, Rob's team was joined by Scott Fischer's ""Mountain Madness"" company on a joint summit attempt, only to come face to face with the omnipotence of nature. In the end, when a furious blizzard struck, disaster was at hand.—Nick Riganas By 1996 guided climbs of Mount Everest has become an industry.

502,7. Room,2015,"A little boy is held captive in a room with his mother since his birth, so he has never known the world outside. ROOM tells the extraordinary story of Jack, a spirited 5-year-old who is looked after by his loving and devoted mother. Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical--they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named ""Room."" Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within ""Room,"" and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.—A24 Five year old Jack's entire life consists of his Ma and whatever he has where they live, Room. Room is an approximate ten by ten by ten foot cubed structure, out of which he's never been. Seven years ago, Ma - Joy Newsome, the daughter of Bob and Nancy Newsome - was abducted by ""Old Nick"", the man who is keeping them captive in Room, which is really a tool shed in his back yard, the shed's only door secured by a number coded keypad, the code which only Old Nick knows. They are dependent on Old Nick for their basic necessities, such as food, water, clothes and utilities. Whenever Old Nick does stay for extended visits in Room, Ma will not let Jack see him or visa versa, Jack who is supposed to hide ""asleep"" in the wardrobe. Old Nick has no desire to see his biological offspring anyway. To shield him from anything that is happening to them, Ma has told Jack that the two of them and Old Nick are the only real things, and that what Jack reads about in books or sees on television are all not real. Jack believes that Old Nick gets their food by magic from television. The only exposure they have to natural light is a skylight at the top of Room, out of which they can only see sky. Joy knows she can't kill Old Nick because they would still be locked in Room. Joy tried to escape only once before Jack was born, that attempt which failed and which resulted in her not having tried again... until now. She has made this decision to try to escape partly due to Jack's age where he can now understand things better, and an incident which showed Joy what were to happen if something truly did happen to Old Nick with them locked inside. If they are able to escape, not only would Jack be required to adjust to a life and a world he may have no comprehension about, but Joy may find that the outside world is much more difficult to adjust to than she imagines, and not only because of the changes to outside in seven years.—Huggo Jack is just five years old, and his entire world is a small, locked space that measures only 11-feet-by-11-feet. Inside the place, many things keep Jack occupied, such as toys, books, and pictures. However, his young mother is his only companion; Mum is the only person who can ensure Jack's safety, especially when Old Nick suddenly visits them, and the boy starts hearing creaking sounds. And then, one day, everything changes when Ma lets Jack in on an exciting, eye-opening secret: outside their confined chamber, there is a new world waiting to be explored--a wondrous place where the sky is blue, and the air is fresh. According to Ma, physical houses, trees, people, and dogs exist just a stone's throw from their strange cabin. But Jack is unsure if Ma is telling the truth or not. Can they make a fresh start beyond the Room?—Nick Riganas Jack (Tremblay) is a young boy of 5 years old who has lived all his life in one room. He believes everything within it are the only real things in the world. But what will happen when his Ma (Larson, in an Oscar-winning performance) suddenly tells him that there are other things outside of Room?

In Minnesota in the 1990s, a man is arrested and accused of having abused his daughter. Although he doesn't remember anything from the event, he pleads guilty. With the help of a psychologist, he'll relive those moments. Meanwhile, the local media hints the possibility that everything could have been a satanic cult's doing.—CarlosERM Against the backdrop of a seemingly endless string of mysterious incidents of satanic ritual abuse in 1990s America, the experienced small-town Minnesota detective, Bruce Kenner, is summoned to investigate the baffling case of the seventeen-year-old runaway girl, Angela Gray. Based on her handwritten letter of unsubstantiated statements, the prime suspect and Angela's father, John, confesses to the hideous crime, even though he has no recollection of his action. With the aid of the expert British psychiatrist, Professor Kenneth Raines, Kenner starts to delve deeper and deeper into the foggy landscape of fluid memories, as the doctor's regressive therapy unearths terrifying traces of occultism. Will John remember what truly happened? Is Bruce the next victim?—Nick Riganas Minnesota, 1990. Detective Bruce Kenner investigates the case of young Angela, who accuses her father, John Gray, of an unspeakable crime. When John unexpectedly and without recollection admits guilt, renowned psychologist Dr. Raines is brought in to help him relive his memories and what they discover unmasks a horrifying nationwide mystery.—yusufpiskin It's 1990 in Hoyer, MN. Taking refuge at her church led by Reverend Beaumont to escape from her family of her father, John Gray, and paternal grandmother, Rose Gray, seventeen year old Angela Gray has accused John of having molested her. Both John and Rose were alcoholics, the reason his son, Angela's older brother Roy Gray, ran away to places unknown, and John's wife left him, with suspicions that John ultimately killed her although her death was ruled accidental. To repent for his alcoholism, John has since become evangelical. In custody, John admits to having indeed molested Angela, but he has no memory of it. In addition to lead police investigator Bruce Kenner, Psychology Professor Kenneth Raines is brought in as a consultant to perform memory-recovery therapy on John to bridge that gap between his belief and whatever is reality. Leading out of that therapy and a further discussion with Angela, Kenner and Raines ultimately come to believe that whatever happened to Angela was orchestrated by a satanic cult, something with which neither has any experience. Kenner in particular becomes more and more invested in the case, especially in feeling like he needs to be Angela's protector, and as such is arguably the most susceptible to the psychological aspects behind what happened to Angela.—Huggo",5.6,"$20,000,000 (estimated)","Ethan Hawke,Emma Watson,David Thewlis,Lothaire Bluteau,Dale Dickey,David Dencik,Devon Bostick,Aaron Ashmore,Peter MacNeill,Adam Butcher,Jacob Neayem,Aaron Abrams,Catherine Disher,Danielle Bourgon,Julian Richings,Kristian Bruun,Luke Marty,Wendy Lyon,Kaitlin Kocsis,Samantha Tenus,J.C.

The naive girl soon comes to realize not everything is as it appears, as ghosts of the past quite literally come out of the woodwork. This movie is more about mystery and suspense than gore.—@Avivafae Buffalo, New York, 1880s. Edith Cushing (played by Mia Wasikowska) is haunted (in some cases, literally) by the death of her mother - she died when Edith was young. Then, she meets an English entrepreneur, Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), the relationship develops, and life seems to be improving. However, her father, Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver), disapproves of Sir Thomas and tries to have Sir Thomas and his scheming sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), sent back to England. Mr Cushing then dies in mysterious circumstances, leaving Edith and Sir Thomas free to wed, which they do. The married couple and Lucille move into the Sharpe ancestral home in England, the run-down Allerdale Hall. Hardly has she moved in than Edith's nightmares become quite vividly real, being haunted by ghoulish apparitions. It's as if the house doesn't want her there.—grantss At the turn of the twentieth century in Buffalo, New York, the aspiring writer Edith Cushing is the daughter of the wealthy entrepreneur Carter Cushing. Edith saw the ghost of her mother that warned her to beware of Crimson Peak when she was a child, and, presently, she is writing a ghost story. Now, she is visiting a publisher that is a friend of her father, and she stumbles upon her childhood friend, the ophthalmologist Dr. Alan McMichael, who has returned from overseas and is opening an office in the same building. Out of the blue, she meets the English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe, who has come to Buffalo with his sister Lucille Sharpe to seek investors for his machine that operates with clay. He has a meeting with Carter Crushing and other businessmen, but Carter refuses to invest in his invention. During the night, the ghost of Edith's mother visits her and warns Edith again to beware of Crimson Peak. Soon, Thomas seduces Edith, and Carter hires a private detective to investigate the lives of Thomas and Lucille. A couple of days later, the detective brings a report to Carter, disclosing dark secrets from the siblings' past. Carter pays a large amount to Thomas to end his relationship with Edith, but he is brutally murdered. Thomas explains to Edith his attitude, and they get married and travel to England to live in his derelict mansion over a red clay mine at Allerdale Hall with Lucille. Edith starts to see a red ghost and discovers that an Italian woman has sent a letter to him. Then, she becomes weak and coughs blood. What is happening to Edith, and what is the mystery of Allerdale Hall and the siblings Sharpe?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In Buffalo, New York, 1887, American heiress Edith Cushing, the young daughter of wealthy businessman Carter Cushing, is visited by her recently deceased mother's black, disfigured ghost who warns her, ""Beware of Crimson Peak."" In 1901, Edith, a budding author, meets Sir Thomas Sharpe, an English baronet who has come to the United States with his sister, Lucille, to seek investors for his clay-mining invention. Unimpressed with Sharpe's previous failures to raise capital, Cushing rejects Thomas's proposal. Edith's mother's spirit once again visits her, bearing the same warning. When Thomas and Edith become romantically involved, both Edith's father and her childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael, disapprove. Mr. Cushing hires a private detective, Mr. Holly, who uncovers unsavory facts about the Sharpes..",6.5,"$55,000,000 (estimated)","Mia Wasikowska,Jessica Chastain,Tom Hiddleston,Charlie Hunnam,Jim Beaver,Burn Gorman,Leslie Hope,Doug Jones,Jonathan Hyde,Bruce Gray,Emily Coutts,Alec Stockwell,Brigitte Robinson,Gillian Ferrier,Tamara Hope,Kimberly-Sue Murray,Sofia Wells,Joanna Douglas,Bill Lake,Jim Watson,Javier Botet,Peter Spence,Danny Waugh,Sean Hewitt,William Healy,Matia Jackett,Karen Glave,Khadijah Roberts-Abdullah,John Carter Craig,Martin Julien,Brian Kaulback,Richard Kerr,Shane McPherson,Tim Blake,Thomas Dorey,Erik Bauersfeld,Joan Washington,Beatrice Basso,Mitzi McCall,Susanne Blakeslee,Drew Davis,T.J.

508,13. The Danish Girl,2015,"A love story loosely inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolve as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer. Copenhagen, Denmark, 1926. Einar Wegener and his wife Gerda are a happily married couple. Both are artists, Einar preferring landscapes and she portraits. One day Einar poses for a portrait of Gerda's while wearing a dress. This is initially done as a lark, as is the later attendance at a party dressed as a woman. However, Einar soon discovers that she is in fact a woman and over time prefers being Lili. At first she and Gerda try to have her situation ""cured"" but this leads nowhere (other than to many doctors trying to have Lili locked up as a pervert and/or lunatic). Her voyage of self-discovery will ultimately lead to her undergoing the first ever sex-change operation.—grantss Copenhagen, Denmark, 1926. Happily married artists Einar and Gerda Wegener come under strain when Gerda playfully asks her husband to fill in for one of her female models. Suddenly, as Einar reluctantly poses for her wearing an elegant dress, the intimate experience triggers a subtle transformation inside the perplexed painter. Convinced he is Lili, a woman trapped in a man's body, Einar boldly accepts his true self and starts living as a woman. But, to everyone's surprise, the radical change is not an ephemeral caprice. After all, Einar is determined to live his new life to the fullest. Despite facing prejudice, discrimination, social dictations, and public outcry, Einar plucks up the courage to fight for the right to be different and undergoes a highly experimental sex reassignment surgery. The trailblazing decision made Lili a notable transgender pioneer.—Nick Riganas 1926. Copenhagen-based married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, who are madly in love, have so far tried unsuccessfully to have a child. They both work as artists, and while Einar has a modicum of critical success for his landscapes, Gerda has not had much critical success with her portraits. An innocent enough request by Gerda to her husband leads to Einar exploring his feminine side. While Gerda sees that exploration all in fun, it becomes more for Einar, who, hearkening back to a time long ago in his past, ultimately allows himself truly to believe that he is a woman, ""Lili"", born into a male body. He wants to experience all that being Lili is, including sexually, and not as Einar pretending to be a woman. The emotions that Gerda develops when she learns what Einar is truly going through spurs some creative energy in her art, which was not present before. Wanting some medical diagnosis for what she is feeling, Lili is told again and again that she is crazy, most physicians who want to institutionalize her on the spot, until she meets Dr. Kurt Warnekros, who believes he can perform two risky gender reassignment surgeries for her fully to become Lili. As such, Lili dreams of getting remarried and having a child in that post-surgery life. Both Lili and Gerda have to decide how long Gerda will go along with Lili for this ride, especially as they both know that the end, if it happens, is that Gerda will lose her husband forever, Lili who states it meaning all of Einar including his art.—Huggo",7.1,"$15,000,000 (estimated)","Alicia Vikander,Eddie Redmayne,Tusse Silberg,Adrian Schiller,Amber Heard,Emerald Fennell,Henry Pettigrew,Claus Bue,Peter Krag,Angela Curran,Pixie,Richard Dixon,Ben Whishaw,Pip Torrens,Paul Bigley,Nancy Crane,Nicola Sloane,Sonya Cullingford,Matthias Schoenaerts,Clare Fettarappa,Jake Graf,Victoria Emslie,Raphael Acloque,Alexander Devrient,Nicholas Woodeson,Philip Arditti,Miltos Yerolemou,Sebastian Koch,Cosima Shaw,Sophie Kennedy Clark,Rebecca Root,Issy van Randwyck,Aisha Fabienne Ross,Holly Weston,Eleanor Hafner,Maya Lindh,Rebecca Clay,Erich Redman,Erling Agergaard,Yvonne Andersen,Mark Behan,Morten Bjørn,Hannah Brackstone-Brown,Louise Dahl,Laraine Dix,Ole Dupont,Julia Effertz,Helen Evans,Josephine Feit,Adam Fischer,Dasha Grady,Yann Grouhel,Jaryd Headley,Eigil Hedegaard,Vicktoria Noell Ingberg,Klaus Ricardo Jakobsen,Samantha Kelly,Paul Kerry,Jacob Utzon Krefeld,Allan Krueger,Marco Marc,Renee McClellan,Julius Mygind,Eitetsu Nozawa,Stephen Parker,Adam Redford,Laurids Riis-Hansen,Sandra Rosko,Teresa Shaughnessy,Johanna Smitz,Carling Talcott,Michael Gade Thomsen,Niki Topgaard,Nadia Townsend,Simon Vinholt,Stephanie Wiese,Alicia Woodhouse",R,Tom Hooper,"Andes Films,Columbia Pictures,Finnkino,Focus Features,NOS Audiovisuais,Toho-Towa,United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures,Universal Pictures Argentina,Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures,7Bravo,Canale 5,Feelgood Entertainment,Home Box Office (HBO),KVH Media Group,Netflix,Sabay MVP,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures,Universal Pictures","Working Title Films,Pretty Pictures,ReVision Pictures,Senator Global Productions,Copenhagen Film Fund,Artémis Productions,Shelter Prod,Taxshelter. be,Tax Shelter du Gouvernement Fédéral Belge,Dentsu,Fuji Television Network (Fuji TV),Kvinde Films","Biography,Drama",119

David Ghantt discovers the true meaning of adventure far beyond his wildest dreams. He is an uncomplicated man stuck in a monotonous life. Day in and day out he drives an armored vehicle, transporting millions of other people's money with no escape in sight. The only glimmer of excitement is his flirtatious work crush Kelly Campbell who soon lures him into the scheme of a lifetime. Along with a group of half-brained criminals led by Steve Chambers and an absurdly faulted heist plan, David manages the impossible and makes off with $17 million in cash...only problem is he foolishly hands the money over to this wild group of double crossers and has been set up to take the fall. With the bandits blowing the millions on lavish and ridiculous luxuries, they leave behind a glaring trail of evidence. Now on the lam and in over his head, David must dodge the authorities, evade a hilarious hit man, Mike McKinney, and try to turn the tables on the ones he trusted most.—Relativity Back in 1997, with the closest thing to adventure being an open spot at Loomis Fargo armoured car business, David Ghantt, a shy, quiet man in his forties, entered the world of thrill and excitement, following his dream. If only it were that simple. Instead, from now on, Ghantt's new reality includes a boring repetitiveness of collecting and delivering money, up until that day that Kelly Campbell, a new and exciting colleague, entered the company's door rocking David's world for good. Inevitably, head over heels for her, David is prepared to do anything for her attention, and before long, he would even accept a key role in an inside job proposed by Kelly and her opportunistic accomplice Steve, the town's petty thief. As one of the selected few who hold the key to the vault, David will be successful in his task and with the intention to please his new sweetheart, he will eagerly cram $17 million in the back of the company's armoured van, in the biggest cash heist in history. However, the security cameras are silently recording..—Nick Riganas A dim-witted armored-car driver is lured into taking part in a massive heist by a seductive co-worker and her criminal accomplice. But when his partners steal the money and betray him, he is forced to evade a police detective and an eccentric hit man while seeking his revenge.. 1997. Somewhat clueless about things in life in general, David Ghantt, a trusted armored car guard with Loomis Fargo, always imagined that his professional life would be full of adventure, the reason he went into the business, his expectation which has been far from the case. His life has the potential to reach that adventurous stage when he is approached by Kelly Campbell, a flirtatious former co-worker recently having quit/gotten fired, she who David can admit he is still attracted to despite being engaged to controlling Jandice Gartrell. Knowing about a recent inside job robbery at a similar security facility, one of Kelly's friends, Steve Chambers, gets Kelly to ask David to be the inside person in a robbery at David's Loomis Fargo facility, the secure area which houses millions of dollars to which he has access. To protect himself, Steve never identifies himself to David, and only uses with David the code name Geppetto as the one ""who pulls the strings"". To sweeten the offer, Kelly tells him that the two of them can start a new life together in Mexico with their share of the loot. Even if David is able to pull off the inside work for the job, he doesn't know two things: that while Steve will arrange for him to go to Mexico using fake identification, Kelly has no intention of going to Mexico with him, the talk still just part of her flirtatious nature; and also unknown to Kelly, Steve has no intention of cutting David in except for the few thousand dollar pocket change to get rid of him, David who can hang out to dry for all Steve cares as David has no idea who he is.—Huggo",5.8,"$25,000,000 (estimated)","Zach Galifianakis,Owen Wilson,Kristen Wiig,Ross Kimball,Devin Ratray,Mary Elizabeth Ellis,Jason Sudeikis,Kate McKinnon,Leslie Jones,Jon Daly,Ken Marino,Daniel Zacapa,Tom Werme,Njema Williams,Nils Cruz,Michael Fraguada,Christian Gonzalez,Candace Blanchard,Karsten Friske,Dallas Edwards,Barry Ratcliffe,Shelton Grant,Laura Palka,Reegus Flenory,Wynn Reichert,Jill Jane Clements,Joseph S.

He always wants to be in control, in large part an outcome of his childhood, where he knows his biological mother willingly gave him up for adoption. That control often places him at odds with those around him, about which he doesn't care as long as he gets what he wants at the end, including a closed end system for each of his products to maintain his vision rather than users being able to transform his products for their own wants. The state of his life is presented at three specific times, on the day of preparation for the launch of three different products, each for which he is the lead: in 1984 for the Macintosh computer, it being the first new product for Apple since the debut its most successful product, the Apple II, seven years earlier; in 1988 for the NeXT computer, which Jobs outwardly is more concerned about the integrity of the perfect black cube design than its unknown capabilities, but for which he secretly has a specific end goal; and in 1998 for the iMac computer. The significant people in Jobs' life are also presented, they who are at the three launches, if not in person than in direct spirit to the proceedings: Steve Wozniak, Apple's other co-founder who sees himself more as the nuts and bolts man compared to Jobs being the big picture man, with Wozniak wanting as much of a focus on Apple's successful brand as opposed to Jobs' want to focus purely on his product being launched; Joanna Hoffman, his ethnic-Polish head of marketing for each of the three launches, and who acts as much as his mother figure and his moral center; John Sculley, Apple's CEO who is more concerned about meeting the wants of the Board and the shareholders than Jobs'; Andy Hertzfeld, one of the two Andy's, who is chief engineer for the Mac and who needs to meet Jobs' every whim for the product, even if he feels it cannot be done; and Lisa Brennan, who the courts deem to be his biological daughter, a claim which he tried to deny largely to spite Lisa's mother, Chrisann Brennan, whose every action, in Jobs' mind, is for her own best interest as opposed to Lisa's as she claims.—Huggo",7.2,"$30,000,000 (estimated)","Michael Fassbender,Kate Winslet,Seth Rogen,Jeff Daniels,Michael Stuhlbarg,Katherine Waterston,Perla Haney-Jardine,Ripley Sobo,Makenzie Moss,Sarah Snook,John Ortiz,Adam Shapiro,John Steen,Stan Roth,Mihran Slougian,Robert Anthony Peters,Noreen Lee,Gail Fenton,Karen Kahn,Rachel Caproni,Lily Tung Crystal,Damara Reilly,Marika Casteel,Dylan Freitas-D'Louhy,Chris Tomasso,John Chovanec,Daniel Liddle,Lora Oliver,Colm O'Riain,Anita Bennett,Greg Mills,Melissa Etezadi,Rick Chambers,Sara Welch,Emmett Miller,Marc Istook,Carlo Cecchetto,Kristina Guerrero,Bill Seward,Mark Mester,Derrin Horton,Timothy A.

523,3. Bridge of Spies,2015,"During the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers. In 1957, lawyer James B. Donovan is recruited from his prestigious law firm to defend accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. It's an unenviable task in many respects. Donovan hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II. Also, the strong anti-Communist mood at the time makes him a target from who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. Just such a scenario comes into play when in 1960 U-2 spy pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down over Soviet territory and taken prisoner. Donovan is again recruited to act as the intermediary and negotiate swapping Able for the American requiring him to travel to East Berlin crossing the newly built Berlin Wall.—garykmcd After Abel, the Russian spy is caught, the US wants to make sure he gets a fair trial so they need someone to defend him. And the man who gets the dubious honor is Jim Donovan who tries to give him a good defense but the government seems intent on making sure he gets convicted. And when Abel is found guilty, Donovan pleads for Abel not to be executed because who knows they might need him as a bargaining chip if an American is captured by the Russians. And when U2 pilot Gary Powers is captured, someone from East Germany sends Donovan a letter claiming to be able to broker an exchange; Powers for Abel. When the CIA learns of this, they want Donovan to go there and broker the deal. He agrees. But when he arrives he is informed that another American is being held by the Germans and he could be the one that's being offered for Abel. But the CIA tells Donovan Powers is the priority. Donovan tries to get both men.—rcs0411@yahoo.com A European man living in the US, Rudolph Abel, is arrested as a Russian spy.

Now Donovan becomes the negotiator in a potential prisoner swap.—grantss In 1957 New York City, Rudolf Abel is arrested and charged with spying for the Soviet Union. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan is prevailed upon to take on the unenviable task of defending Abel, so that Abel's trial will be seen as fair.

The modern world holds many secrets, but the most astounding secret of all is that witches still live amongst us; vicious supernatural creatures intent on unleashing the Black Death upon the world. Armies of witch hunters battled the unnatural enemy across the globe for centuries, including Kaulder, a valiant warrior who managed to slay the all-powerful Queen Witch, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen curses Kaulder with her own immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter in the afterlife. Today Kaulder is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones.

The Witch Queen curses Kaulder with eternal life to make him suffer the loss of his wife and daughter for the eternity. Eight hundred years later, there is a balance in the world and the witches live peacefully among humans. The witch hunter Kauder and The Axe and Cross that judges and imprisons witches in the darkness are the responsible for keeping the world in peace. The priest Dolan 36th is the liaison between The Axe and Cross and Kauder, giving support and keeping the record of his life. On the same day of his retirement, Dolan 36th dies alone in his apartment. Kauder goes to his apartment with Dolan 37th to investigate his death and finds black magic in the spot. Further, he finds that Dolan 36th is still alive under a powerful spell. Now Kauder visits the witch Chloe, who owns a witch bar, to seek her help to recall his own death following clues left by Dolan 36th. However the bar is attacked and destroyed by the witch Beliel and Kauder leaves Chloe under his protection. When she uses her abilities to help Kauder, he learns a dreadful secret about his immortality.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Cursed with immortality after a fierce battle with a dark coven of witches and their horrifying Witch Queen--the evil sorceress who plagued the world with Black Death--the valiant warrior, Kaulder, walks this earth for eight hundred years.

In the present day, Kaulder prevents a teenage witch from unintentionally destroying an airplane with weather controlling runes stored in her luggage. Kaulder is revealed to be working as a witch hunter for the Order of the Axe and Cross, an organization which aims to keep the truce between humans and witches (allowing witches to live freely providing they do not use magic on humans) and either executes or imprisons the witches who break the law.

546,1. The Big Short,2015,"In 2006-2007 a group of investors bet against the United States mortgage market. In their research, they discover how flawed and corrupt the market is. Three separate but parallel stories of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005 are told. Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old ""friend"", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.—Huggo Based on the book by Michael Lewis (writer of Moneyball, Liar's Poker and Flash Boys, among others), the true story of a handful of investors who bet against the US mortgage market in 2006-7. Through their own research they discovered that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst, and they invested accordingly. What they didn't initially know was how structurally flawed the MBS system was, the level of corruption in the market...and the impact on the average person when the bubble burst.—grantss In 2008, Wall Street guru Michael Burry realizes that a number of subprime home loans are in danger of defaulting. Burry bets against the housing market by throwing more than $1 billion of his investors' money into credit default swaps. His actions attract the attention of banker Jared Vennett, hedge-fund specialist Mark Baum and other greedy opportunists. Together, these men make a fortune by taking full advantage of the impending economic collapse in America.—Jwelch5742 In 2008, a group of savvy financiers sensed the looming threat of a subprime mortgage crisis concealed in the subtle warning signs of the mortgage-backed real estate market. Despite the risk, these investors took a bold step and bet against the housing market, reaping immense profits. However, no one could have foreseen the magnitude of the housing bubble and its catastrophic impact on the economy.

547,2. Creed,2015,"The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed. Adonis Johnson is the son of the famous boxing champion Apollo Creed, who died in a boxing match in Rocky IV (1985). Adonis wasn't born until after his father's death and wants to follow his fathers footsteps in boxing. He seeks a mentor who is the former heavyweight boxing champion and former friend of Apollo Creed, the retired Rocky Balboa. Rocky eventually agrees to mentor Adonis. With Rocky's help they hope to get a title job to face even deadlier opponents than his father. But whether he is a true fighter remains to be seen....—Blake ordonez Adonis Johnson lost his mother when he was young and would get into constant trouble and end up in foster care or juvenile detention. One day a woman goes to see him and tells him that her late husband is his father. And her husband's boxing great, Apollo Creed. She would take him in and educate him but he feels the need to be a boxer like his father. So he moves to Philadelphia and approaches Rocky Balboa and asks Rocky to train him. Rocky tries to talk him out of it but it's something he needs to do. Eventually Rocky offers to train him and when he beats a great boxer and his connection to Apollo is revealed, he is offered a chance to fight a world champion and all he needs to do is take the name Creed.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Adonis Johnson is the son of Apollo Creed, former heavyweight champion of the world and the man Rocky Balboa lost to in his first title fight. Apollo Creed died before Johnson was born, so he never knew his father. Johnson is also a fighter and is 15-0, though in unofficial fights in Mexico. Working in an office he decides to fight full time. He leaves Los Angeles and moves to Philadelphia, hoping to get Rocky Balboa as his trainer. Eventually they team up, and slowly Johnson's career starts to take shape. Meanwhile, the light heavyweight champion of the world, Englishman Ricky Conlan, is looking for someone to fight...—grantss Even before he discovered he was the illegitimate son of former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed who died in the ring before he was born, Los Angeles residing Adonis Johnson - Donny under more familiar circumstances - was always naturally using his fists to deal with life's issues. And even after Apollo's widow, Mary Anne Creed, took Donny in to raise after he was shuttled from group home to group home following his own mother's passing, Mary Anne in the process giving him a privileged life to do with whatever his heart desires, Donny still decides he wants to box as a career in honor of the father he never knew. Up to him making this decision, Donny had been self-taught, fighting solely in what could only be considered street brawls in Mexico despite they taking place in boxing rings. Those that know of Donny's heritage see him as untouchable to train due to the way his father died. As such, he decides to proceed without using the Creed name so that he can make it on his own terms, with only those that need to know knowing. In also not using the Creed name, he will not sully his father's legacy if he doesn't succeed. He moves to Philadelphia in hopes of training under another former heavyweight champ, Rocky Balboa, who was his father's nemesis but who ended up being his friend in their ultimate respect for each other in the ring. Rocky, who does learn who Donny is as one of the people who needs to be in the know, initially declines Donny's request as having put the life of boxing behind him. However, Donny is able to wear Rocky down for Rocky eventually to agree to become his trainer. Rocky coming out of boxing retirement raises some questions as to why and the eventual discovery of Donny's Creed heritage. While the Creed-Balboa combination in name alone can open doors, both Donny and Rocky have to decide if using the Creed name is the right move specifically for Donny, especially with others who may have ulterior motives not in Donny's best interest. Regardless of what they decide to do, they will spiritually have others in their corner: Mary Anne, who despite not liking Donny's career path, still wants to see her adoptive son thrive and succeed in whatever he does; Donny's girlfriend, Bianca, who is nonetheless facing her own issues as an aspiring singer who has progressive hearing loss; and Apollo, who lives in both Donny himself and Rocky. Through it all, other real life issues taking place outside the ring may factor into what happens to Donny.—Huggo",7.6,"$35,000,000 (estimated)","Michael B.

548,3. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,2015,"Katniss and a team of rebels from District 13 prepare for the final battle that will decide the fate of Panem. After young Katniss Everdeen agrees to be the symbol of rebellion, the Mockingjay, she tries to return Peeta to his normal state, tries to get to the Capitol, and tries to deal with the battles coming her way...but all for her main goal: assassinating President Snow and returning peace to the Districts of Panem. As her squad starts to get smaller and smaller, will she make it to the Capitol? Will she get revenge on Snow or will her target change? Will she be with her ""Star-Crossed Lover,"" Peeta, or her long-time friend, Gale? Deaths, bombs, bow and arrows, a love triangle, hope... What will happen?—baileyyybroooks After Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire, accepted the role of the Mockingjay, the symbol of rebellion against the autocratic Capitol, she and the rebels of District 13 poise an all-out war against them; however, this time Katniss has a personal agenda: assassinating President Snow herself to gain revenge not only for Panem's sake but for her own as well. After accepting her role as the Mockingjay, Katniss Everdeen, along with her team, prepares to take their fight straight to the ruthless Capitol. While her mission is to bring President Snow down once and for all, Katniss finds that her squad dies at the hands of either Mutts, Peacekeepers or both. Once in the Capitol, Katniss discovers that there is another threat rising that could decide not only her fate but the future of all Panem.—Blazer346 For all past deaths made as entertainment, and for the insidious modification of Peeta, Katriss deems to strike out on her own to take down President Snow once and for all, but being the Mockingjay, the living symbol of the rebellion now headed by Alma Coin, has its drawbacks. Recognition, for one, and she finds herself saddled with a team of expert warriors (which surprisingly includes the ailing Peeta) aimed to penetrate the Capitol that has barricaded itself behind Hunger-Game-style death traps. As she closes in on carrying out her private agenda through more deaths and mayhem, President Snow himself makes her aware of another threat to peace for Panem equal to himself, leaving her to consider how to truly end the bloodshed.—statmanjeff",6.6,"$160,000,000 (estimated)","Jennifer Lawrence,Josh Hutcherson,Liam Hemsworth,Woody Harrelson,Donald Sutherland,Philip Seymour Hoffman,Julianne Moore,Willow Shields,Sam Claflin,Elizabeth Banks,Mahershala Ali,Jena Malone,Jeffrey Wright,Paula Malcomson,Stanley Tucci,Natalie Dormer,Evan Ross,Elden Henson,Wes Chatham,Eugenie Bondurant,Sarita Choudhury,Stef Dawson,Meta Golding,Patina Miller,Omid Abtahi,Joe Chrest,Michelle Forbes,Misty Ormiston,Kim Ormiston,Gwendoline Christie,Robert Knepper,Mark Jeffrey Miller,April Grace,David Hallyday,Linds Edwards,Thomas Blake Jr.,Cameron MacConomy,Desmond Phillips,Elle Graham,Larissa Dmitriew,Kate Rachesky,Phillip Troy Linger,Bear Lawrence,Theodore Lawrence,Jasmine Ahnie,Andrew Almanza,Evan D.

560,15. Love the Coopers,2015,"The intertwined stories of four generations of Coopers unfold right before the annual family reunion on Christmas Eve. Can they survive the most beautiful time of the year? When four generations of the Cooper clan come together for their annual Christmas Eve celebration, a series of unexpected visitors and unlikely events turn the night upside down, leading them all toward a surprising rediscovery of family bonds and the spirit of the holiday.—CBS Films In anticipation of a great family reunion, happily married Sam and Charlotte make the necessary preparations for the memorable night. Everyone is expected: their children, Hank and Eleanor; their grandchildren; Charlotte's father, Bucky; her sister, Emma, and, of course, Aunt Fishy. Little by little, as the intertwined stories of four generations of Coopers unfold, well-kept secrets, unspoken desires, and intimate wishes begin to surface, just before the dinner on Christmas Eve. Sooner or later, the Coopers will have to realise that--even though it is easy to lose track of their shared lives--occasionally, unexpected encounters can bring hope and joy when they least expect it. Can the Coopers survive the most beautiful time of the year?—Nick Riganas Sam and Charlotte are divorcing after forty years of marriage. Charlotte convinces Sam to wait until after their grown children (Hank and Eleanor), grandchildren (Hank's kids Charlie, Bo and Madison), Charlotte's father and sister (Bucky and Emma) and Sam's aunt (Fishy) have enjoyed one last ""perfect Christmas"" before announcing the planned divorce. As scenes shift back and forth across the Cooper family members, their memories also briefly appear on screen as younger versions of themselves.. As is the annual ritual, four generations of the extended Cooper family are convening for Christmas Eve dinner at the Pittsburgh home of the family nucleus, Charlotte and Sam Cooper, married for forty years. They will not make it to forty-one as there has been one last straw on both sides in they having drifted apart in promises not kept. As Christmas is Charlotte's favorite time of year, she has convinced Sam not to tell the family of their impending divorce until after the holidays so that they can have one last perfect Christmas together. What they are unaware of is that no one considers these Christmas Eve dinners as being within the perfect family in their collective dysfunction. Emma, Charlotte's younger single sister, has always felt in competition with Charlotte, only exacerbated by their father Bucky having slotted them into specific types, as such Emma having been picked up for shoplifting in ""buying"" the perfect Christmas gift for Charlotte. Having been caught makes Emma's ability to attend dinner slim as she is escorted to the police station by emotionally detached Officer Percy Williams. Lonely Bucky spends his days at a local diner just to be able to spend time with a young waitress, Ruby, who he has befriended. He is saddened not only to learn that Ruby is leaving town for good in wanting to find a better i.e. happier life in what is a random move, but that she did not have the courage to tell him directly. Sam's care facility residing Aunt Fishy is largely in her own world in being in an early stage of Alzheimer's. Charlotte and Sam's son Hank, having just gone through a divorce from Angie and being father to three children, has just lost his job as a department store photographer, which he has told no one in trying to maintain his ""financial"" Christmas commitments, this only what he sees as his latest failure. Hank and Angie's oldest son, mid teen Charlie, can now only think about approaching his first crush, Lauren Hesselberg, without being too obvious in his feelings for her. And Charlotte and Sam's daughter Eleanor, flying in from out of town, has decided to hang out at a bar in the airport for as long as possible rather than go home in not wanting to face Charlotte's judgment for still being single. Reality is worse: Eleanor is in a long distance sex-only relationship, it necessarily commitment-free as he is married. In hanging out at the airport, Eleanor meets Joe, a soldier snowed in and who will probably spend Christmas alone in the airport. They make an uneasy connection, that unease due to their philosophical differences about most things in life. The Coopers' collective story is largely told by arguably the happiest member of the family, Rags, Charlotte and Sam's faithful dog who can view things both at an intimate and objective level.—Huggo",5.8,"$17,000,000 (estimated)","Steve Martin,Diane Keaton,John Goodman,Ed Helms,Alex Borstein,Timothée Chalamet,Maxwell Simkins,Blake Baumgartner,Amanda Seyfried,Alan Arkin,Dan Amboyer,Marisa Tomei,Scott Garan,Dorothy Silver,Olivia Wilde,Channing Sebetich,Mike Pusateri,Jake Lacy,June Squibb,Larry McKay,Kanani Rose,Anthony Mackie,Molly Gordon,Sylvia Kauders,Krista Marie Yu,Lev Pakman,M.R.

575,5. In the Heart of the Sea,2015,"A recounting of a New England whaling ship's sinking by a giant whale in 1820, an experience that later inspired the great novel Moby-Dick. In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will, and an almost human sense of vengeance. The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" reveals the encounter's harrowing aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down. A dramatisation of the true events that inspired Herman Melville's classic novel ""Moby Dick"". In 1820 the whaling ship Essex sets sail from Nantucket, Massachusetts. After a largely fruitless search in the Atlantic she heads for the west coast of South America. There she hears about rich whaling grounds several hundred miles west. After reaching the whaling grounds she is attacked and sunk by massive white sperm whale. The crew take to the boats in what will be an epic struggle for survival.—grantss In 1850, author Herman Melville visits innkeeper Thomas Nickerson, the last survivor of the sinking of the whale-ship Essex, offering money in return for his story. Nickerson initially refuses, but then finally agrees when his wife intervenes. The story turns to 1820: a whaling company in Nantucket has refitted the Essex to participate in the lucrative whale oil trade, and 14-year-old Nickerson signs on as a cabin boy. The owners hire veteran whaler Owen Chase as first mate, though he is disappointed not to receive a captain's commission. The captain is George Pollard, an inexperienced mariner from an established whaling family who envies Chase's skill and popularity. Chase and Pollard clash, leading Pollard to sail into a storm against Chase's advice. The two agree to put their differences aside, rather than risking their reputations by returning to port without profit, and soon, the crew kills their first bull sperm whale. Almost three decades after the life-altering events that sent the ill-fated whale-ship, Essex, at the bottom of the cold Pacific Ocean, the epic whaling novel Moby-Dick's soon-to-be writer, Herman Melville, visits the tragedy's only survivor, Tom Nickerson, circa 1850. A fourteen-year-old novice seaman back in 1820, Nickerson recounts a story of greed, man's arrogance, and the omnipotence of nature, as Nantucket's veteran whaler, Owen Chase, and his inexperienced captain, George Pollard, came face to face with the ocean's ultimate Leviathan--an all-powerful bull sperm whale. However--helpless and stranded in the unforgiving open sea--the men would also have to face adversaries even mightier than the pale-hued avenger of the deep waters: despair, and the ugliest face of human nature.—Nick Riganas",6.9,"$100,000,000 (estimated)","Chris Hemsworth,Benjamin Walker,Cillian Murphy,Brendan Gleeson,Ben Whishaw,Michelle Fairley,Tom Holland,Paul Anderson,Frank Dillane,Joseph Mawle,Edward Ashley,Sam Keeley,Osy Ikhile,Gary Beadle,Jamie Sives,Morgan Chetcuti,Charlotte Riley,Nicholas Jones,Donald Sumpter,Richard Bremmer,Jordi Mollà,Victor Solé,Nordin Aoures,Santi López,Cristhian Esquivel,Harry Jardine,Jamie Michie,Andy Wareham,Mark Southworth,Frans Huber,Christopher Keegan,Stephanie Jacob,Kierron Quest,Luca Tosi,Nick Tabone,Martin Wilde,Michael Cronin,Oliver Andrews-Waller,Hayley Joanne Bacon,Alexander Bracq,Jill Buchanan,Cheryl Burniston,Robert F.

Deep undercover, and with his life in danger, he strives to prove these athletes are the architects of the mind-boggling crimes that are devastating the world's financial markets. A former extreme sports athlete, Johnny Utah, joins the FBI.

They use the challenges as a front to pull off daring robberies and are lead by the charismatic, fearless Bodhi.—grantss Extreme sport athlete Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey), and his friend Jeff (Max Thieriot), are traversing a steep ridge-line on motorbikes. The run ends with a jump onto a lone stone column, where Jeff overshoots the landing and falls to his death. Seven years later, Utah is an FBI agent candidate. He attends a briefing on a skyscraper heist, in which the criminals steal diamonds, escaping by parachute, in Mumbai. A similar heist happens over Mexico where the criminals unload millions of dollars in bills over Mexico, then disappear into the Cave of Swallows. Utah's research concludes that they were done by the same men, who are attempting to complete the Ozaki 8, a list of eight extreme ordeals to honor the forces of nature.. Forced to renounce his former adrenaline-charged life after the untimely death of a dear friend, the extreme sports enthusiast, Johnny Utah, shifts focus to become an F.B.I. field agent. Before long, Johnnie will have to put his athletic background to good use, when a highly trained team of thrill-seekers use their expertise to perform impossible robberies--and then, like modern Robin Hoods--give away everything. As Utah picks up where he left off to infiltrate the gang of the dauntless daredevils, more and more, it becomes clear that there is a pattern, and that the fellow athlete, Bodhi, knows more than he's letting on.

But his plans turn upside down when their biological father, Dusty Mayron, returns. Stepfather Brad Whitaker is hoping for his stepchildren to love him and treat him like a dad. All is going well until the biological father, Dusty Mayron, shows up, then everything takes a toll. His stepchildren start putting him second and their father first, and now Dusty will have to learn that being a good dad is about pains and struggles. Brad will also experience once again what it's like to be a stepdad. Aspiring to be the perfect husband to his beautiful new wife, Sarah, and the best super-dad to her two young kids, Megan and Dylan, the smooth-jazz radio-station manager with a heart of gold, Brad, is, indeed, a beloved stepfather. However, just as things started to work out for the family, Brad's polar opposite and Sarah's cool ex-husband with the perfect six-pack, Dusty, decides to pay a visit for a quick catch-up with the children. Suddenly, this new alpha-dad gets all the attention in the house with his impressive skills, dragging Brad in a fierce no-holds-barred competition for the ""King of the Castle"" title. Who will prevail in this mano-a-mano paternal face-off?—Nick Riganas Mild-mannered radio executive Brad Whitaker struggles to be a good stepfather to his wife Sara's two children, Megan and Dylan, and is seemingly sterile after an accident to his testicles some years ago.

One night, the kids' biological father, Sara's ex-husband Dusty Mayron, calls and discovers Sara's marriage with Brad. He suddenly announces he will be visiting the next day. Sara hesitates to let her ex-husband into their home, but Brad convinces her that it is important for the kids that their father and stepfather establish a respectful relationship..

581,11. Eddie the Eagle,2015,"The story of Eddie Edwards, the notoriously tenacious British underdog ski jumper who charmed the world at the 1988 Winter Olympics. Eddie the Eagle is a feel-good story inspired by true events, about Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards (Taron Egerton), an unlikely but courageous British ski-jumper who never stopped believing in himself--even as an entire nation was counting him out. With the help of a rebellious and charismatic coach (Hugh Jackman), Eddie takes on the establishment and wins the hearts of sports fans around the world by making an improbable and historic showing at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. From producers of Kingsman: The Secret Service, Eddie the Eagle stars Taron Egerton as Eddie, the loveable underdog with a never say die attitude.—20th Century Fox In 1973, 10-year-old Eddie Edwards dreams of Olympic glory, practicing in various Olympic events and failing miserably. His mother unconditionally supports him, while his father constantly discourages him. As a young teen, he gives up his dream of participating in the Summer Games in favor of skiing in the Winter Games. Although successful at the sport, he is rejected by British Olympic officials for being uncouth. Realizing he could make the team as a ski jumper (a sport in which the United Kingdom had not participated in six decades), he decamps to a training facility in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The more seasoned jumpers, specifically those on the Norwegian team, belittle him. A semi-fictional account of the rise to fame of 'Eddie 'The Eagle Edwards is told, he, since a young age, whose aspiration to be an Olympian far stronger than the odds against him in not being very athletic, not being very coordinated, being nearsighted, and not having the meaningful support, financial or otherwise, to achieve the goal, besides the emotional support of his mother who did not want to burst the dreams of a child. By 1987, at 22, he managed to teach himself an Olympic sport which he performed adequately, namely downhill skiing. Regardless, he is told by the British Olympic Committee that he would not only not make the 1988 British Olympic ski team, this the one and only year he would even have a shot in being prime age, but that he never would in just not having enough inherent talent as an athlete. In learning that the Brits are not and have not fielded a team since the 1920s and that under existing British Olympic Committee rules he would only need to have completed a sanctioned competition to qualify, Eddie decides instead to change sports to make it into the 1988 Winter Olympics despite never haven participated in the sport at all before: ski jumping, he traveling to Garmisch, Germany to learn how to do it. Added to the list of positives fighting the odds against is the needed attribute of fearlessness. Unlike the self teaching he has done before with skiing and other sports, Eddie quickly discovers that that will only take him so far in not even being able to jump the smaller Olympic hill, the 70m, without that help. He is able to secure a ""coach"" of sorts, Bronson Peary, despite Bronson not totally agreeing with Eddie's motives. Bronson is a black sheep like Eddie in being an American ex-jumper from the 1970s who fell out of favor with the sport's establishment, including his then coach Warren Sharp, Bronson now an alcoholic and piste driver at Garmisch, where no one except the all knowing Petra, a server at a local bar, knows his truth. But with every step forward Eddie and Bronson are able to take, they hit one wall after another, from the British Olympic Committee, other athletes, especially members of the British Olympic team and other ski jumpers, and his father, who only wants him to focus on a real life and not an unachievable pipe dream.—Huggo Cheltenham, U.K., 1973. More than anything, Eddie Edwards, a 10-year-old blue-collar weakling, wants to be an Olympian. And in 1987, at 22, Eddie finally gets a chance to make his ambitious dream come true when the plucky boy makes his way to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. By tackling the big jumps with the help of coach Warren Sharp's former U.S. ski-jumping champion Bronson Peary, Edwards becomes the first British ski jumper to compete in the games since the 1920s. Inexperienced, underfinanced, ill-equipped, and ill-prepared, the courageous underdog athlete enters the make-or-break 90-metre jump for the first time and writes history as 'Eddie 'The Eagle Edwards.—Nick Riganas",7.3,"$23,000,000 (estimated)","Tom Costello,Jo Hartley,Keith Allen,Dickon Tolson,Jack Costello,Taron Egerton,Mark Benton,Tim McInnerny,Edvin Endre,Mads Sjøgård Pettersen,Marc Benjamin,Iris Berben,Rune Temte,Hugh Jackman,Carlton Bunce,Joachim Raaf,Sean Jackson,Daniel Ings,Jim Broadbent,Matt Rippy,Graham Fletcher-Cook,Ania Sowinski,Paul Reynolds,Christopher Walken,Jessica Allain,Lasco Atkins,Denis Banovic,Roy Beck,Daz Black,Matthew Brandon,Austin Burrows,Robert F.

Manifesto draws on the writings of Futurists, Dadaists, Fluxus artists, Suprematists, Situtationists, Dogma 95 and other artist groups, and the musings of individual artists, architects, dancers and filmmakers, editing and reassembling them as a collage of artists' manifestos, ultimately questioning the role of the artist in society today. Performing these 'new manifestos' while inhabiting thirteen different personas - among them a school teacher, a puppeteer, a newsreader, a factory worker and a homeless man - Cate Blanchett imbues new dramatic life into these famous words in unexpected contexts.—AnonymousB Through an intricate collage of art manifestos ranging from Situationism to Stridentism, and from Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier's Dogme 95 to the avant-garde Dada, the chameleonic Cate Blanchett delivers each manifesto embodying a distinct persona. The linear theoretical meditation on the artistic ideas is interpreted by the performer's intricate alter egos by means of radical transformations: she is a raving homeless man, a fifth-grade teacher, a despotic Russian choreographer, a confident anchorwoman.
