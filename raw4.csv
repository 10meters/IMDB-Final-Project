0,1. Promising Young Woman,2020,"Nothing in Cassie's life is what it appears to be - she's wickedly smart, tantalizingly cunning, and she's living a secret double life. Now, an unexpected encounter is about to give Cassie a chance to right the wrongs from the past. Cassie, an emotionally scarred medical school dropout pushing thirty, knows firsthand that some wounds never heal. But time and life wait for no one; defined by a hideous crime involving a bosom friend, the once-brilliant student is still treading water. However, Cassie thinks she has found the perfect way to cope with the painful past. So, at night, she visits the local bars as a vulnerable punisher on the prowl for all sorts of nocturnal predators and wolves in sheep's clothing. After all, the hunted sometimes becomes the hunter. And then, kindly old classmate Ryan enters the picture; he's the bee's knees, and he knows it. Now Cassie wants out. But everyone knows that breaking bad habits is easier said than done. Could Ryan be the one? Has luck finally smiled upon the promising wild thing?—Nick Riganas Nothing in Cassie's life is what it appears to be -- she's wickedly smart, tantalizingly cunning, and she's living a secret double life by night. Now, an unexpected encounter is about to give Cassie a chance to right the wrongs from the past. Thirty year old Cassie Thomas' life outwardly is a mess. After she dropped out of medical school, she moved back in with her parents. As she seems to make no attempt to do anything beyond working a dead end job as a coffee house clerk, her parents make no bones about wanting Cassie to move on, mostly to move out of their house. She has no friends except her boss Gail, who, somewhat like Cassie's parents, makes sly attempts to get Cassie into a better position at least with work. But this dead end life masks Cassie's current true mission, which all stems from the reason why she dropped out of medical school. Her meticulously planned actions have one of two intended goals: to make sure that what happened in medical school does not happen to anyone else in a similar position; or to exact revenge on the people she feels were either the cause or contributed to that medical school incident which led to a tragic end. Cassie's plan potentially takes a turn when she runs into an old medical school classmate, Ryan Cooper, who is the antithesis of all those for who she acts out her parables.—Huggo",7.5,N/A,"Adam Brody,Ray Nicholson,Sam Richardson,Carey Mulligan,Timothy E.

When he tries to understand what is happening around him, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality. Having scared off his latest caregiver, Anthony, an ailing octogenarian Londoner gradually succumbing to dementia, feels abandoned when his concerned daughter, Anne, tells him she's moving to Paris. Confused and upset, debilitated by his rapid mental decline and warped perspective, Anthony loses his grip on reality as he struggles to navigate the opaque landscape of the present and past. As a result, fading memories and glimpses of lucidity trigger sudden mood swings, distorting Anthony's surroundings, loved ones, and even time. But why has his younger daughter stopped visiting? And who are the strangers that burst in on Anthony?—Nick Riganas A series of vignettes, often building upon themselves, is presented from the perspective of Anthony, an elderly Londoner, in his home. The next in the series often contradicts the previous, leading to the question of what is real and what is in Anthony's mind, possibly of things from his past that are no longer, in the one thing that is certain: that Anthony suffers from Alzheimer's. Those vignettes that are not from his perspective show what is real in his life: that he has an adult daughter Anne and that Anthony has only recently moved in with her and her husband Paul in Anthony driving away the caregivers that Anne had hired for him when he lived on his own. While Anne loves her father, their relationship is often strained in his waning lucidity and the negative effect his constant presence is having on her marriage.

While her eccentric and old-fashioned boss tasks her to process Salinger's voluminous fan mail, she struggles to find her own voice.—micro_scope Brimming with optimism, the young college student, aspiring writer, and poet, Joanna Smith Rakoff, arrives in mid-90s New York City after landing a temporary job as an assistant at stern Margaret's prestigious literary agency. Entrusted with the unglamorous task of dealing with fan letters, Joanna is utterly unaware, however, that the agency represents the interests of literary giants, such as Dylan Thomas and F. Scott Fitzgerald, to name a few, and the office's most prominent client: the notoriously reclusive writer, J.D. Salinger. But, more than anything in the world, bright-eyed Joanna wants to extraordinary. Can she learn a thing or two about life and writing from the famous author of ""The Catcher in the Rye""?—Nick Riganas 1995. Originally from the suburbs of New York City, Berkeley post-graduate student Joanna, on a visit home, decides on the spur of the moment to leave behind her life at Berkeley, including musician boyfriend Karl, to try and eke out a life as a writer, most specifically a poet, in New York City. In her personal life, she immerses herself in the ""aspiring"" literary world in beginning a relationship with Marxist wannabe novelist and bookstore clerk Don. But looking for a proverbial nine-to-five job to pay the bills, Joanna is advised by a placement agent to look for a job with a literary agent instead of a publisher if her end goal is to write. She ends up getting a job as the assistant to Margaret, a high powered literary agent whose highest profile client Joanna learns is ""Jerry"": J.D. Salinger. In working for somewhat tyrannical and proverbial ""old school"" Margaret who abhors new technology such as computers, Joanna ends up being no more than a glorified secretary whose main jobs are to type out Margaret's Dictaphone recorded notes, and to read, respond to using the appropriate form letter on file, then shred all personal letters addressed to Salinger, who thirty-four years ago issued the directive that he would no longer accept any such mail in his increasing reclusive and eccentric nature.

A beautiful, talented daughter who is brutally murdered as she honeymoons in blissful ignorance. Soon after, the strangest of postcards arrives on the desk of Swedish art critic Dessie Larsson... Across Europe, couples are being ruthlessly butchered in deliberate acts of violence with no end in sight.

198,7. The Trial of the Chicago 7,2020,"The story of 7 people on trial stemming from various charges surrounding the uprising at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. In Chicago 1968, the Democratic Party Convention was met with protests from activists like the moderate Students for a Democratic Society led by Tom Hayden and the militant Yippies led by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, which led to violent confrontations with the local authorities. As a result, seven of the accused ringleaders are arraigned on charges like Conspiracy by the hostile Nixon administration, including Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers who was not involved in the incident. What follows is an unfair trial presided by the belligerent Judge Hoffman (No relation) and prosecuted by a reluctant but duty-bound Richard Schultz. As their pro bono lawyers face such odds, Hayden and his fellows are frustrated by the Yippies' outrageous antics undermining their defense in defiance of the system even while Seale is denied a chance to defend himself his way. Along the way, the Chicago 7 clash in their political philosophies even as they learn they need each other in this fight.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol1970@gmail.com) What was intended to be a peaceful protest at the 1968 Democratic National Convention turned into a violent clash with police and the National Guard. The organizers of the protest--including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, and Bobby Seale--were charged with conspiracy to incite a riot. The trial that followed was one of the most notorious in history.—yusufpiskin 1969. With the new Richard Nixon administration in the White House, US Attorney General John Mitchell proceeds to lay charges against Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, leaders of Students for Democratic Society, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, leaders of the Youth International Parties (Yippies or Young Hippies), David Dellinger, leader of Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam (The Mobe), individuals Lee Weiner and John Froines, and Bobby Seale, National Chair of the Black Panthers, under the never used Rap Brown Law: for ""conspiracy to cross state lines in order to incite violence"" for their roles in the protest outside the National Democratic Convention (DNC) in Chicago the summer previous, the protest which turned violent. The protest was against the United States' escalating participation in the Vietnam War, the DNC chosen for then President Lyndon B. Johnson's doubling of troops almost overnight and the presumptive Democratic nominee for President, Hubert H. Humphrey, continuing such if elected. In part as they are using the same legal team of William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass, the first seven are deemed the Chicago 7, with Seale the outsider for many reasons, including he being the only one of the eight a person of color. If convicted, they could serve a maximum penalty of ten years in prison. While the eight are aware of each other, some had never met before the protest and rarely collaborated. As such, the lead prosecutor, Richard Schultz, as does everyone else involved in this case, is aware that the charges and thus the trial are politically motivated rather than a matter of justice under the law, with each of the eight of the eight hundred or so protesters chosen for very specific political reasons, and as former Attorney General under Johnson, Ramsey Clark, had no intention of laying charges after the Justice Department's review.—Huggo In the wake of the bloody events before and after the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where unarmed protesters were pitted against armed-to-the-teeth police officers in Lincoln Park, Attorney General John Mitchell, appoints prosecutors, Richard Schultz and Tom Foran, to bring eight men to trial for inciting violence. In 1969, under Richard Nixon's presidency, eight alleged ringleaders faced charges of conspiracy and promoting riot. They were the Conspiracy Eight: Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, enthusiastic and silver-tongued leaders of the Students for a Democratic Society; Yippies, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, who ran the Youth International Party; radical pacifist and conscientious objector, David Dellinger; anti-war activist, John Froines; teaching assistant, Lee Weiner, and co-founder of the Black Panther Party, Bobby Seale, whose case was eventually declared a mistrial. Apart from Bobby Seale, all the defendants were represented by William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass, who were convinced that the charges are politically motivated. The judge was bigoted Julius Hoffman who refused to let the progressive, former U.S. Attorney General, Ramsey Clark, testify in front of the jury. But, who started the riots? Was it the protesters or the police?—Nick Riganas",7.7,"$35,000,000 (estimated)","Eddie Redmayne,Alex Sharp,Sacha Baron Cohen,Jeremy Strong,John Carroll Lynch,Yahya Abdul-Mateen II,Mark Rylance,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Ben Shenkman,J.C.

Reimagining Roald Dahl's beloved story for a modern audience, Robert Zemeckis's visually innovative film tells the darkly humorous and heartwarming tale of a young orphaned boy who, in late 1967, goes to live with his loving Grandma in the rural Alabama town of Demopolis. As the boy and his grandmother encounter some deceptively glamorous but thoroughly diabolical witches, she wisely whisks him away to a seaside resort. Regrettably, they arrive at precisely the same time that the world's Grand High Witch has gathered her fellow cronies from around the globe-undercover-to carry out her nefarious plans. Zemeckis is joined by a world-class team of filmmakers, including Alfonso Cuarón, Guillermo del Toro and Kenya Barris. The cast includes powerhouse performances from Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci, Kristin Chenoweth and Chris Rock, with newcomer Jahzir Kadeen Bruno as the brave young hero.—Warner Bros./HBOMax It may come as a surprise; but, witches are real.

And before long, a hair-raising encounter with the supernatural jolts grandma into action, forcing her to take her boy to a luxurious seaside hotel far away from home to protect him. Unfortunately, the otherwise impeccable resort is rife with danger, as a secret coven of fashionable witches is holding its annual conference in plain sight.

316,2. The Mauritanian,2021,"Mohamedou Ould Slahi fights for freedom after being detained and imprisoned without charge by the U.S. Government for years. Based on the NY Times best-selling memoir ""Guantánamo Diary"" by Mohamedou Ould Slahi, this is the true story of Slahi's fight for freedom after being detained and imprisoned without charge by the U.S. Government for years. Alone and afraid, Slahi finds allies in defense attorney Nancy Hollander and her associate Teri Duncan who battle the U.S. government in a fight for justice that tests their commitment to the law and their client at every turn. Their controversial advocacy, along with evidence uncovered by a formidable military prosecutor, Lt. Colonel Stuart Couch, uncovers shocking truths and ultimately proves that the human spirit cannot be locked up.—STXfilms The real life story of Mauritanian national Mohamedou Ould Slahi's detainment at Guantanamo Bay in the aftermath of the 911 attacks on suspicions that he was the mastermind recruiter for some of the 911 pilots is dramatized. In 2005 in a general writ of habeus corpus which allows the uncharged detainees at Guantanamo Bay to have their cases heard in light of not being charged, Albuquerque based law partner Nancy Hollander is convinced at least to look at Slahi's case on the indirect request of his family back in Mauritania, who just learned of he being at Guantanamo Bay after he left home one day late in 2001 in volunteering to go with authorities not to be seen again. Hollander, choosing her junior colleague Theresa Duncan in needing someone who speaks at least one of Slahi's languages, decides to take the pro bono case against the protestations of her law partners who believe the publicity of a being a ""terrorist lover"" will hurt the firm's reputation. Hollander and Duncan's mission to provide a legal defense is made all the more difficult in Slahi's overall suspicions, not so much of his two lawyers who he doesn't know from a hole in the wall regardless, but about information he provides being used against him while in Guantanamo. Their opposing counsel does not have any easier a task. He, Marine Corps officer Stuart Couch, does have a personal vested interest in the case in knowing some who perished in 911 in direct actions by the terrorists that day, but he knows that his personal feelings need to be put aside for him to win the case based on the evidence. It is that evidence which the government is hesitating on providing and if the lawyers on both sides can get their hands on the materials may eventually dictate what happens with the case and Slahi's fate.—Huggo",7.5,"$14,000,000 (estimated)","Tahar Rahim,Nouhe Hamady Bari,Saadna Hamoud,Mohamed Yeslem Mousse,Mohamed Abderrahmane Arava,Aly Deyde,El Hocine Aba,Baya Belal,Baba Mine,Lemrabott Zeine Sidamar,Yenje Abdellahi,Jodie Foster,Shailene Woodley,Clayton Boyd,Denis Ménochet,Pope Jerrod,Daniel Janks,Ralph Lawson,Michael MacKenzie,Benedict Cumberbatch,Corey Johnson,Adam Neill,Darron Meyer,Lionel Strasky,Langley Kirkwood,Taurai Maposa,Thandi Sebe,Rob van Vuuren,Toni Jean Erasmus,Saamer Usmani,Thabo Rametsi,Jemal Mennah,David Fynn,Kirk Nel,Bongo Mbutuma,Michelle Allen,Shane John Kruger,Arthur Falko,Ahmed El Khadar,Hamza Mennah,Stevel Marc,Adam Rothenberg,Alaa Safi,Justine Mitchell,Zachary Levi,Limam Saleck Hemett,Mohamed Yahya,Elbar M'Boirik,Mohamed Lemjed Mohamed Lemine Salem,Maude Sandham,Bonko Khoza,Matthew Marsh,Melissa Haiden,Zak Rowlands,Meena Rayann,Kiroshan Naidoo,Randy Yav,Nahum Hughes,Sobantu Nqayi,Mahyar Kouhi,Francis Chouler,Evan Hengst,Walter van Dyk,Leon Clingman,Katie Farringer,Miles Petzer,Anele Matoti,Roxy Nel,Litha Bam,Robert Hobbs,Nezar Alderazi,Mark Sykes,Daniel Kühne,Andre Jacobs,Daniel Barnett,Greg Philip Davies,Theresa Duncan,Nancy Hollander,Mohamedou Ould Slahi",R,Kevin Macdonald,"Film & TV House,GEM Entertainment,Dutch FilmWorks (DFW),Elevation Pictures,Kino Films,Metropolitan Filmexport,PVR Pictures,STX Entertainment,Shaw Organisation,3+,4+,ARD TV,Amazon Instant Video,Arbeitsgemeinschaft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (ARD),BGFilm,BfParis,Cinemundo,Das Erste,Entract Films,Google Play,Leonine Distribution,MDR Fernsehen,MagentaTV,Maxdome Store,Maxdome,Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR),NDR Fernsehen,Netflix,Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR),ONE,RBB Fernsehen,Rakuten TV,Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB),SWR Fernsehen,Sky Cinema Best Of,Sky Cinema Premieren +24,Sky Cinema Premieren,Sky Cinema Special,Sky Cinema Thriller,Südwestrundfunk (SWR),TOBIS Home Entertainment,Top Film Distribution,Videoload,Youtube Filme & TV,iTunes","Wonder Street,30WEST,BBC Film,Convergent Media,Great Point Media,Shadowplay Features,SunnyMarch,Topic Studios","Biography,Crime,Drama,History,Thriller,War",129

369,5. Man of God,2021,"Exiled unjustly, convicted without trial, slandered without cause. Man of God depicts the trials and tribulations of Saint Nektarios of Aegina, as he bears the unjust hatred of his enemies while preaching the Word of God. Man of God brings to life the incredible true story of Saint Nectarios of Aegina, Greece. A priest of the common people, his humility annoyed the prideful orthodox clergy of the day. In contrast to his religious superiors - the bishops and patriarchs mesmerized by worldly honors and power - Nectarios cared for the poor; taught peasant girls to read and write; inspired by example young men to enter the priesthood; and wrote books and delivered sermons that uplifted nations of believers. In this exquisitely made film, relive Nectarios' inspiring devotion and perseverance as, despite the efforts of the religious establishment to discredit him and dismantle his good works over decades, he embraced humility and inspired thousands to become one of Greece's most renowned saints.—Wikipedia The ever-growing popularity of Saint Nektarios of Aegina (1846 - 1920), the then Metropolitan Bishop of Pentapolis, sparks jealousy in the ranks of the high-level orthodox priests in Alexandria. And for fear of becoming the next Patriarch of Alexandria, a portion of the clergy embarks on a systematic smear campaign against Nektarios, bent on driving him out of Egypt. As a result, Nektarios relocates to Athens, Greece, where he touches the hearts of the needy and dedicates himself to teaching and writing.

She soon meets a pair of thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they build a life for themselves on the streets of London. However, when Estella befriends fashion legend Baroness von Hellman, she embraces her wicked side to become the raucous and revenge-bent Cruella.—avenueviera Against the backdrop of 1970s London emerging punk scene, Estella, a creative and rapaciously ambitious fashion genius, finds herself in the right place at the right time.

A small family in a lonely outpost on Mars is attacked by bandits. One of the bandits, Jerry, survives and kills the family father. He attempts to integrate into the family, demanding thirty days to prove himself to the surviving mother Ilsa and child daughter Remmy. Over time, Ilsa seems to warm to him, but after thirty days, Ilsa tries to shoot him. She fails as the magazine of the gun that Jerry intentionally left was empty, and Jerry kills her in the ensuing struggle. Remmy, who resents Jerry's presence, grows sullen and spends much of her time with ""Steve"", a pet-like robot found in a storage unit. Remmy also discovers that their farm is within a large force field bubble that keeps breathable air inside. This makes clear that the bandits came from outside or another similarly shielded area. Years pass, and Remmy, now a young woman, remains sullen and almost completely silent around Jerry. They have an argument over whether to have a child, and Remmy decides to run away, but Jerry stops her from doing so.

Leda is a middle-aged divorcee devoted to her work as an English teacher and to her two children. When her daughters leave home to be with their father in Canada, Leda anticipates a period of loneliness and longing. Instead, slightly embarrassed by the sensation, she feels liberated, as if her life has become lighter, easier. She decides to take a holiday by the sea, in a small coastal town in Greece. But after a few days of calm and quiet, things take a menacing turn. Leda encounters a family whose brash presence proves unsettling, at times even threatening. When a small, seemingly meaningless event occurs, Leda is overwhelmed by memories of the difficult, unconventional choices she made as a mother and their consequences for herself and her family. The seemingly serene tale of a woman's pleasant rediscovery of herself soon becomes the story of a ferocious confrontation with an unsettled past.

Having spent nearly half her life being at war with her wants, needs, and even her impulses, this time, Leda is bent on enjoying her vacation--after all, it's the little things in life that count. However, as Leda whiles away the time going to the beach, reading, and relishing the joy of eating alone, unfavourable omens and an impertinent intrusion in the shape of beautiful Nina's boisterous family threaten to blemish the fleeting illusion.
