4,5. Captain Fantastic,2016,"In the forests of the Pacific Northwest, a father devoted to raising his six kids with a rigorous physical and intellectual education is forced to leave his paradise and enter the world, challenging his idea of what it means to be a parent. Ben and Leslie Cash live largely off the grid with their offspring -- Bodevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai -- in a cabin in the mountains of Washington state. The parents have passed their socialist and survivalist ideals to their children. Ben considers most of Western society to be fascist, especially corporate America. He also believes that no one will or should be there for you, so you'd better learn how to take care of yourself. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training; know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains, and even fractures; and know how to hunt, forage, and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however, within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslie's health. Formerly an attorney, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben believes that this disorder started with her postpartum depression with Bo. Yet Leslie's condition has worsened. Despite not believing in Western medicine, Ben sends Leslie to a hospital close to Ben's sister, Harper, so that there can be family close by. While hospitalized, Leslie commits suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslie's act brings out a battle between Ben and Leslie's father, Jack Bertrang, a Christian who not only blames Ben for Leslie's death, but believes that what he is doing ""to"" the children can legally be considered abuse. Jack takes over the funeral arrangements as per his and his complacent wife Abby's Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslie's wishes, as she believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, Ben and the children believe it is their mission to honor Leslie's last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophy. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long dormant issues between the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life.—Huggo Anti-capitalist Ben Cash lives in the wilderness with his wife, Leslie, and their six children: Bo, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja, and Nai, whom they have educated, teaching them how to survive along with high-level homeschooling that includes politics and philosophy. Bo has been accepted to leading universities. Then Leslie is hospitalized for bipolar disorder. When she commits suicide, Ben decides to travel to the funeral with his children to fulfill her will of being cremated, instead of the traditional burial that her father Jack wants for his daughter. Jack threatens to call the police and have Ben arrested if he attends the funeral. Along the journey of Ben and his children, Bo meets teenager Claire and falls in love with her. They spend one troubled night with Ben's sister Harper, her husband Dave, and cousins Justin and Jackson. When they arrive at the church, Jack and his wife Abigail are surprised to see them. Ben makes a speech disclosing Leslie's will to the guests, and is expelled from the ceremony. Now Jack wants custody of his grandchildren. What will Ben do?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Ben Cash, his wife Leslie and their six children live in the Washington wilderness. Ben and Leslie are former anarchist activists disillusioned with capitalism and American life, and chose to instill survivalist skills, left wing politics, and philosophy in their children - educating them to think critically, training them to be self-reliant, physically fit and athletic, guiding them without technology, demonstrating the beauty of coexisting with nature and celebrating Noam Chomsky's birthday instead of Christmas..",7.8,"$5,000,000 (estimated)","Viggo Mortensen,George MacKay,Samantha Isler,Annalise Basso,Nicholas Hamilton,Shree Crooks,Charlie Shotwell,Trin Miller,Kathryn Hahn,Steve Zahn,Elijah Stevenson,Teddy van Ee,Erin Moriarty,Missi Pyle,Frank Langella,Ann Dowd,Galen Osier,Hannah Horton,Rex Young,Thomas Brophy,Mike Miller,Greg Crooks,Louis Hobson,Hafid Abdelmoula,Paul Alan Amend,Ben Andrews,Heidi Barrientes,Richard Beal,Matt Harrison,Gail Harvey,Shannon Henderson Herrera,Alan Humphrey,Elizabeth M.

7,8. The Boy,2016,"An American nanny is shocked that her new English family's boy is actually a life-sized doll. After she violates a list of strict rules, disturbing events make her believe that the doll is really alive. Greta, a young American woman, takes a job as a nanny in a remote English village and discovers that the family's 8-year-old is a life-sized doll that the parents care for just like a real boy as a way to cope with the death of their actual son 20 years ago. When she violates a list of strict rules, her worst nightmare is brought to life by a series of disturbing, inexplicable events and she comes to believe that the doll is alive.—STX Entertainment Greta Evans, a young American from Montana, is hired as a nanny by the Heelshires. When she arrives in their small town in the United Kingdom, the elderly couple show Greta her charge: a porcelain doll named Brahms that they treat like their son. They then close the doors behind them so that they can ask Brahms if he wants Greta as his babysitter. The old couple come out and say that Brahms agreed despite having ""rejected"" many previous babysitters. Over the next day, the couple coach Greta on taking care of Brahms and their house, leave her a list of rules to follow, then leave for a holiday. The rules include speaking louder than usual when reading a book to Brahms, leaving food out on the table and not throwing it away, and setting up rat traps. Initially, Greta ignores the rules about the doll and follows her own routine. She regularly calls her sister Sandy, who tells her that her abusive ex-boyfriend Cole has been trying to find out where she is.. Eager to break free from her dark past, young Greta Evans flies across the pond after landing a job as a nanny at the Heelshires' isolated mansion somewhere in the English countryside. Once there she realizes that pain and grief can lead to strange paths, as her silver-haired employers need her to look after Brahms, the eerily lifelike porcelain doll they treat as their son. At first glance, this is a simple task, but she still must follow a very specific set of inflexible rules. Before long, as Greta pays no attention to the strict guidelines, bizarre things begin to happen, and an intangible but ominous presence haunts the manor's dark corridors. Is Greta starting to lose her grip on reality? What is the well-hidden secret of the cryptic Heelshire family?—Nick Riganas Elderly couple Heelshire prepares for a long-awaited holiday by welcome handsomely paid nanny Greta Evans, a broke US airhead fleeing her abusive ex Cole, for their pre-teen son Brahms. She promises to follow instructions despite finding it's a porcelain doll, and ignores it lazily once the owners leave her alone in the spooky, stately lonesome home.

In February of 1952, one of the worst storms to ever hit the East Coast struck New England, damaging an oil tanker off the coast of Cape Cod and literally ripping it in half.

As a result, for the next twelve long hours, whether they like it or not, the unfortunate captives must play the inhumane game of ""31"", and survive the onslaught of chainsaw-wielding jokers, Nazi tormentors, and the ultimate adversary: Doom-Head, the clown from Hell.

31,7. How to Be Single,2016,"A group of young adults navigate love and relationships in New York City. There's a right way to be single, a wrong way to be single, and then...there's Alice. And Robin. Lucy. Meg. Tom. David. New York City is full of lonely hearts seeking the right match, be it a love connection, a hook-up, or something in the middle. And somewhere between the teasing texts and one-night stands, what these unmarrieds all have in common is the need to learn how to be single in a world filled with ever-evolving definitions of love. Sleeping around in the city that never sleeps was never so much fun. Josh was the perfect dorm mate and graduated to devoted fiance for Alice, but she insists on 'a break' to 'find herself' on search of a paralegal career in New York. By the time she's ready to crawl back, he committed to a smarter woman. Meanwhile she joined a loose band of lonely hearts in the Big Apple, drawn along with corpulent but shameless law firm colleague Robin, who jumps any male bones which allow her. handsome, suave bar man Tom on the other hand has his slick ways to let girls come to him as one night stands and be out of his hair the next day, yet he makes an exception.—KGF Vissers Four women with vastly different ideas about love and relationships navigate the single life of New York City. Taking a break from her long-term boyfriend Josh (Nicholas Braun), Alice (Dakota Johnson) sets out on a journey of self-discovery with her hard-drinking new friend Robin (Rebel Wilson). Meanwhile, Alice's career-driven older sister Meg (Leslie Mann) struggles with the idea of settling down, and uptight romantic Lucy (Alison Brie) searches for her perfect match.. In New York City, Alice, Meg, Robin and Lucy, loosely or not so loosely connected, are four women at different emotional stages of being single. Never having been alone, Alice, freshly out of college and in her first real job as a paralegal, decided that she needed a break in her four year relationship with her college sweetheart Josh, who is heartbroken from the news, with Alice saying that she will return to him when she finds what she needs in that solitude. She assures him that sowing oats or another man are not factors in her decision. Alice has no skills to be alone and thus, perhaps without even realizing it, may put out those vibes to men in wanting a relationship, whether it be with Josh or anyone else. Years after a painful break-up, Meg, Alice's older sister, has focused on her career as an obstetrician, although she herself has no desire to have any children of her own in not actually liking children. When she changes her mind and decides to have a baby through IVF and sperm from a bank in still not wanting a man in her life, she does not seem to have space for a significant other even if one stumbles into her realm, even one that loves everything about her and is not deterred by any of her craziness, pregnancy related or not. Robin, Alice's coworker, doesn't seem to have any personal boundaries or respect for anyone else's boundaries in being the ultimate party girl who overindulges in everything associated with partying, including the frequency of her sexual encounters with whoever can match her needs that evening. And Lucy, who lives above the bar they all frequent, the bar where she hangs out more often than her own apartment in it having more reliable WiFi, is methodical yet so far unsuccessful in her approach to finding her life mate, he who has to check off a number of boxes. The common bond between them all in terms of a man is Tom, the venue's bartender who is up front with all the women he hooks-up with that he has no interest in anything with them immediately after their sexual encounter, with the majority of those hook-ups only hearing what they want to hear which is not what he tells them.—Huggo",6.1,"$38,000,000 (estimated)","Dakota Johnson,Rebel Wilson,Leslie Mann,Damon Wayans Jr.,Anders Holm,Alison Brie,Nicholas Braun,Jake Lacy,Jason Mantzoukas,Colin Jost,Mickey Gooch Jr.,Sarah Ramos,Vanessa Rubio,Zani Jones Mbayise,Brent Morin,Kay Cannon,Judith Lightfoot Clarke,Patrick Boll,Anna Eilinsfeld,Charlotte Kirk,Angela Bellotte,Kevin Yamada,Richie Moriarty,Paul Laudiero,Richard 'Bumper' Walker,Ali Marsh,Patrick J.

37,13. Race,2016,"Jesse Owens' quest to become the greatest track and field athlete in history thrusts him onto the world stage of the 1936 Olympics, where he faces off against Adolf Hitler's vision of Aryan supremacy. In the 1930s, Jesse Owens is a young man who is the first in his family to go to college. Going to Ohio State to train under its track and field coach, Larry Snyder, the young African American athlete quickly impresses with his tremendous potential that suggests Olympic material. However, as Owens struggles both with the obligations of his life and the virulent racism against him, the question of whether America would compete at all at the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany is being debated vigorously. When the American envoy finds a compromise persuasive with the Third Reich to avert a boycott, Owens has his own moral struggle about going. Upon resolving that issue, Owens and his coach travel to Berlin to participate in a competition that would mark Owens as the greatest of America's Olympians even as the German film director, Leni Riefenstahl, locks horns with her country's Propaganda Minister, Josef Goebbels, to film the politically embarrassing fact for posterity.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) This drama based on true events focuses on legendary black athlete Jesse Owens (Stephan James) and his inspiring journey to overcome racism at home and abroad, culminating in his triumphant track-and-field performance at the 1936 Berlin Olympics under the tutelage of gruff Ohio State coach Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis). In a time of racial bigotry, discrimination, and anti-Semitism, the humble African-American track-and-field athlete, Jesse Owens, catches the eye of early-1930s Ohio State University's coach, Larry Snyder. Against the backdrop of heated debates and political clashes as to whether the United States of America should boycott Berlin's 1936 Olympic Games, eventually, Owens arrives in Nazi Germany, as Adolf Hitler, and Third Reich's Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, intend to turn the Olympics into a showcase for Aryan superiority, through the lens of the young filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl. However, as the track knows no colour, there can only be fast winners and slow losers. And Jesse is already a winner.—Nick Riganas Is a dramatization of the life of black American sprinter Jesse Owens in the three years leading up to the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, largely meant as a showcase for the Nazi regime's Aryan superiority race policy, which is most specifically anti-Semitic. He is already facing challenges in going to school at Ohio State in the racial segregation and racial discrimination against the black population in much of US society. The one person who doesn't care what color Jesse is is Ohio State track coach Larry Snyder, an alumnus and former world class runner in his own right whose job is on the line in not having yet mentored an Olympic-caliber athlete. Beyond working on technique, Larry works on Jesse's mental state, he needing to black out all the literal and proverbial external noise to be successful, which gets more and more difficult with Jesse's greater notoriety and the increasing pressure on him to win. Much of that other noise relates to the many ""what ifs"" in the racial issue: what if the Nazi regime does not allow black and Jewish people to compete; what if the US boycotts the Olympics to protest those race policies; what if he decides not to go to the Olympics also in protest; and what if he does go and loses.—Huggo",7.1,"$35,000,000 (estimated)","Stephan James,Jason Sudeikis,Eli Goree,Shanice Banton,Carice van Houten,Jeremy Irons,William Hurt,David Kross,Jonathan Higgins,Tony Curran,Amanda Crew,Barnaby Metschurat,Chantel Riley,Vlasta Vrana,Shamier Anderson,Jesse Bostick,Moe Jeudy-Lamour,Gaetan Normandin,Jacob Andrew Kerr,Dondre Octave,Jeremy Ferdman,Giacomo Gianniotti,Tim McInnerny,Jonathan Aris,Nicholas Woodeson,Larry Day,Jon McLaren,Michèle Lonsdale Smith,Andrew Moodie,Adrian Zwicker,Bruno Bruni Jr.,Marcus Bluhm,Glynn Turman,Manuel Sinor,Anthony Sherwood,Justus Carrière,Karl Graboshas,Daniel Joshua,Matt Keyes,Steffen Mennekes,Ricky Watson,Frank Schorpion,Milo Larratt,Anian Zollner,Eric Davis,Tim Post,John Maclaren,James R.

39,15. Genius,2016,"A chronicle of Max Perkins's time as the book editor at Scribner, where he oversaw works by Thomas Wolfe, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and others. When, one day in 1929, writer Thomas Wolfe decided to keep the appointment made by Max Perkins, editor at Scribner's, he had no illusions: his manuscript would be turned down as had invariably been the case. But, to his happy amazement, his novel, which was to become ""Look Homeward, Angel,"" was accepted for publication. The only trouble was that it was overlong (by 300 pages) and had to be reduced. Although reluctant to see his poetic prose trimmed, Wolfe agreed and was helped by Perkins, who had become a true friend, with the result that it instantly became a favorite with the critics and a best seller. Success was even greater in 1935 when ""Of Time and the River"" appeared, but the fight for reducing Wolfe's logorrheic written expression had been even harder, with the novel originally at 5,000 pages. Perkins managed to cut 90,000 words from the book, and with bitterness ultimately taking its toll, the relationships between the two men gradually deteriorated. Wolfe did not feel grateful to Perkins any longer but had started resenting him for owing his success to him.—Guy Bellinger",6.5,,"Colin Firth,Jude Law,Nicole Kidman,Laura Linney,Guy Pearce,Dominic West,Vanessa Kirby,Gillian Hanna,Angela Sant'Albano,Eve Bracken,Katya Watson,Lorna Doherty,Makenna McBrierty,Miquel Brown,Corey Johnson,Lucy Briers,Harry Attwell,Ray Strasser King,David Altaner,Rosy Benjamin,Charles Dinsdale,Erick Hayden,Kenneth Hazeldine,Oliver King,Alex Large,Charlotte Longfield,Nick Mercer,Kim Rosenfeld,James Wallace,Katherine Kingsley,Richard Clark,Stella McCabe,Christopher Oram,Mike Vessey,Maddie Rice,Ian Drysdale,Richard Dempsey,Alistair Sanderson,Alexander Scrivens,Cassandra Nina,Pamela Okoroafor,Kenji Fenton,Neville Malcolm,Winston Rollins,Chris Storr,Frank Tontoh,Jamal Crawford,Kemi Durosinmi,Jo Dyce,Kevin Ketti,Lesley Mutombo-Agbepa,Joshua Robinson,Andrew Byron,Jane Perry,James Bierman,Trina Dillon,Gary Thompsett,Elaine Caulfield,Mark Phillimore,Paul Anderton,Fraser Andrews,Mark Arnold,Richard Banks,Bill Bekele,Sophia Brown,Glenn Bunn,Greg Canestrari,David Christopher-Turner,Bern Collaço,Crystal Compton,Gioacchino Jim Cuffaro,Nick Davison,Sam Ettleman,Robin George,Craig Goult,Jason Grangier,Shonn Gregory,Marc Hockley,David Howkins,Joy Isa,Alex Jaep,Ian Jenkins,James E Jones,Jim Maidment,Martyn Mayger,Craig McGrath,Maximus Morgan,Karl Ng,Tim Packham,Kumud Pant,Cory Peterson,Margot Richardson,Boyd Rogers,Matthew Rohman,Leon Seth,Atul Sharma,Avinashi Sharma,Bob Stott,Steven F Thompson,Sean White,Patricia Winker",PG-13,Michael Grandage,"Lionsgate,Roadside Attractions,Elevation Pictures,Diamond Films,Diamond Films,Eagle Pictures,FilmNation Entertainment,Longride,Mars Distribution,NOS Audiovisuais,OctoArts Films,Paradiso Entertainment,Paradiso,Shaw Organisation,Spentzos Films,Wild Bunch,Ascot Elite Entertainment Group,Dreamwest Pictures,Future Film,IPA Asia Pacific,Pinema,Film1,Paradiso Home Entertainment,Transeuropa Video Entertainment (TVE),Universum Film (UFA),Universum Film (UFA),Yleisradio (YLE),Wild Bunch Germany","Desert Wolf Productions,Michael Grandage Company,Riverstone Pictures,Ingenious,Pinewood Pictures","Biography,Drama",104

When she emerges ready to rebrand herself as America's latest sweetheart, not everyone she screwed over is so quick to forgive and forget. The story follows Michelle Darnell, a titan of industry who is sent to prison for insider trading, denounced by her former lover, Renault, who still holds a heavy grudge towards her for their breakup, after getting a promotion a few years ago. After doing her time, Michelle emerges, ready to re-brand herself as America's latest sweetheart, but not everyone she steamrolled is not so quick to forgive and forget. With nowhere to go and no one to scam, Michelle is forced to move in with former assistant Claire and her young daughter, Rachel. Now at her lowest point, Michelle wastes no time in devising a winner-take-all plan to rebuild her empire.. Michelle Darnell is the wealthy (she the forty-eighth richest woman in the US), successful, narcissistic, brash, and over-the-top businesswoman of her self-branded empire based in Manhattan. She is a manifestation of her upbringing, she, an orphan, having been rejected by a series of parents who did adopt her but ended up sending her back to the Catholic orphanage. Her life changes abruptly when turned in to the authorities by cutthroat business rival Renault (whose real name is Ronald, he changing it to sound more important) for insider trading, he a serious boyfriend twenty-five years ago before either became rich and successful. Upon her release from prison, Michelle, now bankrupt with no where to go and no one to turn to with her most recent associates having burnt their bridges in their true dislike for her, ends up turning to who was her hard working but unappreciated assistant, single mom Claire Rawlings, taking Michelle into her tiny Brooklyn apartment only on the urging of her empathetic ten year old daughter, Rachel Rawlings. With none of those former associates even wanting to speak to her, Michelle has to find a way to get back on her feet to the style to which she is accustomed. She believes she's found a way through both Rachel and Claire, who have to decide if Michelle is worth the risk, her business plan which does have at its core girl empowerment which she herself learned the hard way.

Living among the wolves in the jungle, young man cub Mowgli quickly learns to live life among his wolf pack and all the animals that inhabit the jungle, but when the villainous tiger Shere Khan threatens Mowgli's life, black panther Bagheera offers to take Mowgli to a nearby man village where he will be safe from the tiger's wrath. Along the way, Mowgli gets tangled up in a series of encounters with a sly snake named Kaa, a swimmingly ruthless gigantopithecus named King Louie and a lazy bear named Baloo, who quickly becomes his guide to the 'bear necessities' of life.—Blazer346 An epic adventure about Mowgli, a man-cub raised by a family of wolves. Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan, who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he's ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera, and the free-spirited bear Baloo. Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don't exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa, a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie, who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire.—Jwelch5742 Mowgli is a ""man cub"" raised by the wolf Raksha and her pack, led by Akela, in an Indian jungle ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the black panther Bagheera. Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf siblings, while Akela disapproves of him using human tricks like building tools instead of learning the ways of the pack. One day, during the dry season, the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains as part of a truce during a drought that enables the jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of being eaten by their predators. The truce is disrupted when a scarred tiger named Shere Khan arrives, detecting Mowgli's scent in the large crowd. Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a warning that he will kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether they should keep Mowgli or not. In the heart of the dense jungle, Bagheera, the wise black panther, takes pity on an abandoned infant named Mowgli.

78,4. Criminal,2016,"A dangerous convict receives an implant containing the memories and skills of a dead CIA agent. Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is a CIA agent on a mission in London tracking down a shadowy hacker nicknamed ""The Dutchman"" (Michael Pitt). When he gets mysteriously ambushed and killed, an experimental procedure is used to transfer his memories into dangerous convict Jerico Stewart (Kevin Costner). When he wakes up with the CIA agent's memories, his mission is to find The Dutchman and make the deal with him before the hacker launches ICBM's and starts World War III. But complications soon arise and the mission turns personal. Captured by a Spanish anarchist before he seals a deal with the profit-motivated hacker known only as the ""Dutchman"", the London-based CIA operative, Bill Pope, is killed in the line of duty. Suddenly, retrieving the memories and the invaluable information inside the brain of the dead agent become the bureau's top priority--and with the help of Dr Franks' radical procedure--his knowledge is transplanted into the troubled brain of the perfect candidate: the emotionless psychopath, Jerico Stewart. Now, as Jerico's fragmented memories become inextricably intertwined with Pope's classified information about the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile system, he becomes the target of both the CIA and the anarchists. Is a volatile criminal our last hope?—Nick Riganas London based CIA operative Billy Pope is killed in his unsuccessful attempt to complete a deal with computer hack Jan Strook, better know online by his handle The Dutchman, for a wormhole program that allows its user to circumvent nuclear codes to launch at will, that deal being the program itself, immunity, a passport, and $10 million. Billy's superior, Quaker Wells, employs Dr. Micah Franks to conduct an untested surgery to transfer Billy's brain functions into another human to be able to access Billy's memory in the goal to discover The Dutchman's hidden location and thus the wormhole program, and where Billy hid the not recovered $10 million. The test subject chosen for his unique physiological brain structure is incarcerated Jerico Stewart, an extremely violent and remorseless criminal with the emotional capacity of a child. Shortly after the surgery, Jerico is able to escape custody, with Wells and Franks unaware of Jerico's mental state. The surgery was partially successful in that Billy's mental functions are conflicting with Jerico's. As Wells and his team go on a quest not only for Jerico but also The Dutchman, The Dutchman himself, in that not completed transaction with Billy, has the wormhole program for sale at that same price, the Russians who are in the market. Overriding it all is former businessman Xavier Heimdahl, The Dutchman's former partner in the wormhole program and Billy's murderer. Xavier's main mission is retrieving the program itself. As such, Xavier is also after Jerico and The Dutchman, and will use whomever he needs to achieve his goal, including targeting Billy's loving family, his wife Jill Pope and their adolescent daughter Emma Pope.—Huggo",6.3,"$31,500,000 (estimated)","Kevin Costner,Gary Oldman,Tommy Lee Jones,Ryan Reynolds,Jordi Mollà,Gal Gadot,Michael Pitt,Amaury Nolasco,Alice Eve,Antje Traue,Scott Adkins,Lara Decaro,Freddy Bosche,Emmanuel Imani,Harry Hepple,Doug Cockle,Colin Salmon,Steve Nicolson,Sope Dirisu,Gisella Marengo,Mark Kempner,Mike Bodie,Joshua James,Samantha Coughlan,Danny Webb,David Avery,Joe Fidler,Michael Webber,Katharine Gwen,Richard Alan Reid,Kelly Clare,Joanna Brookes,Matthew Steer,Andrew Byron,Elizabeth Ross,James Richard Marshall,Henry Garrett,Tim Woodward,Lotte Rice,Nathan Osgood,Sarah Middleton,Dragos Savulescu,Tamer Doghem,Priyanga Burford,Didi Anderson,Amina Zia,Rio Fredrika,Steven Brand,Natalie Marie Ames,Piers Morgan,Luca Giorgio Maggiora,Mark Rhino Smith,Louis Tamone,Sophie Ross,Samuel Turner O'Toole,Mark Underwood,Ian Burfield,Nathan Aldous,Jozef Aoki,Lee Asquith-Coe,Amy Clare Beales,Gintare Beinoraviciute,Andres Austin Bennett,Tom Bennett,Laura Bernardeschi,Paul Biddiss,Paul Blackwell,Dilyana Bouklieva,Alexander Bracq,Jennifer Brenner,Steve Brunton,Jill Buchanan,Perry Burke,Natalie Burn,Nathanjohn Carter,Max Cavenham,Jamie B.

81,7. A Kind of Murder,2016,"In 1960s New York, Walter Stackhouse is a successful architect married to the beautiful Clara who leads a seemingly perfect life. But his fascination with an unsolved murder leads him into a spiral of chaos as he is forced to play cat-and-mouse with a clever killer and an overambitious detective, while at the same time lusting after another woman. A psychological noir thriller set in 1960s New York based on Patricia Highsmith's novel 'The Blunderer'. Walter Stackhouse is rich, successful, and unhappily married to beautiful but damaged Clara. His desire to be free of her feeds his obsession with Kimmel, a man suspected of brutally murdering his own wife. But when Clara is found dead in suspicious circumstances, Walter's string of lies and his own guilty thoughts seem enough to condemn him. As his life becomes dangerously entwined with Kimmel's, a ruthless cop is increasingly convinced that he has found a copycat killer in Walter and aims to nail both murderers. When Walter Stackhouse, an architect with a passion for writing, stumbles across an article about the unsolved murder case of Helen Kimmel, the gradual descent into a pit of lies, betrayal, and guilt awaits him. More and more--as unhappily-married Walter seeks inspiration for his crime novel--he finds himself entangled in a thorny mystery, but without realizing that he's alienating himself from Clara. Now, before a precarious situation, morbid thoughts start flooding Walter's confused mind, as Clara's untimely death intertwines the two deaths that share a small but strange resemblance. As flimsy fabrications and inescapable contradictions multiply, who will be able to tell the difference between a liar and a murderer?—Nick Riganas In 1960s New York, Walter Stackhouse is an architect married to beautiful Clara and leading a seemingly-perfect life.

Eventually, as the two opposite couples will soon find themselves in a head-on collision, an inevitable showdown amidst the rugged and sun-baked landscape of West Texas, will lead to unforeseen consequences.—Nick Riganas Following the death of their mother after an illness, adult brothers Tanner and Toby Howard, both penniless, begin a spree of masked bank hold-ups in small towns in West Texas, Toby having no real experience in such. They only want a few thousand dollars in each hold up, and only hit virtually empty Texas Midlands Bank branches where there are fewer things that can go wrong. Their end goal is to pay off the $40,000 reverse mortgage loan taken out on the family ranch, the bank which will foreclose in a few weeks if payment is not made in full. Toby wants to leave the ranch to his two sons to be held in trust for their financial security, they who he never sees following the divorce from his wife. Tanner and Toby believe it is poetic justice that they plan to achieve their goal by paying Texas Midlands, which holds the loan, with their own money. Although they have the same goal, the brothers having different temperaments may pose problems for them, Tanner, an ex-con, who is tempestuous and impetuous, while Toby is more introspective. Meanwhile, Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton and his second in command Alberto Parker are investigating the hold-ups. Hamilton, who is close to retirement and who takes great pleasure in needling Parker for his part native Indian heritage, may have his own motives in how he decides to proceed in what may very well be his last case, Hamilton's actions often much to Parker's exasperation.—Huggo",7.6,"$12,000,000 (estimated)","Dale Dickey,Ben Foster,Chris Pine,William Sterchi,Buck Taylor,Kristin K.

She knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home. She knows she likes working in The Buttered Bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her boyfriend Patrick. What Lou doesn't know is she's about to lose her job or that knowing what's coming is what keeps her sane. Will Traynor knows a road accident took away his desire to live. He knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how he's going to put a stop to that.

Will's mother Camilla Traynor, supported by her husband Stephen Traynor, hires the inexperienced but happy Lou to take care of her son together with his nurse Nathan.

103,4. The Nice Guys,2016,"In 1970s Los Angeles, a mismatched pair of private eyes investigate a missing girl and the mysterious death of a porn star. In 1977 Los Angeles, single father and licensed PI Holland March (Gosling) is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of famous porn star Misty Mountains. As the trail leads him to track down a girl named Amelia (Qualley), he encounters less-licensed and less-hands-off private eye Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) and his brass knuckles, both hired by the young hippie. However, the situation takes a turn for the worse when Amelia vanishes and it becomes apparent that March wasn't the only interested party. As both men are forced to team up, they need to take on a world filled with eccentric goons, strippers dressed as mermaids, and even a possible government conspiracy.—@onecriticalgeek In 1977 Los Angeles, Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a private investigator, of sorts. He is the man you call when someone needs to be given a message, violently. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is more legit and conventional, taking cases involving tracking down missing persons and the like. Their paths cross when porn star Misty Mountains dies in a car crash. Misty's aunt hires March because she believes that Misty is still alive. Their investigations lead them to a young woman named Amelia and a massive conspiracy plot.—grantss In early 1977 Los Angeles, those who know him probably consider Holland March--a widower, former police officer, and heavy drinker--the worst private detective they know. He's also not the greatest father; his 13-year-old daughter Holly March must often act as the adult in the house. Although he does bilk clients to keep a roof over his and Holly's heads--a rental in the Hollywood Hills--their seemingly never-to-be-realized plan is to rebuild their burnt-down house. A man who literally lives by his fists, Jackson Healy is a freelance enforcer, largely sticking up for those at risk--although for absolutely no less than the price he specifies. Jackson and Holland's paths cross when they have a mutual person of interest, a young woman named Amelia, who has hired Jackson to protect her against two unknown men who have been following her, and as she is associated to a missing woman's case on which Holland is working. That case is of porn actress Misty Mountains, whose aunt asked Holland to locate her; the nearsighted woman swears she saw Misty two days after she was known to have been killed in a very high-profile car accident. When Amelia goes missing too, Jackson and Holland join forces to locate her, knowing she's probably in danger of being killed by those two now not-so-unknown men and perhaps by others pulling strings behind the scenes, Jackson and Holland possibly getting caught in the crossfire in the process. Often along for the ride is Holly, who feels she can be of use to them in people opening up to her about information, feeling more comfortable around an innocent kid instead of two adult males. The probability that Amelia is in danger becomes more clear when almost everyone associated with Misty's last movie ends up dead, and Amelia does have a connection to it. Eventually, they learn of the reason Amelia has gone into hiding, which goes against what most people would consider common logic. However, Jackson, Holland, and Holly must sift through the rhetoric to discover the truth.—Huggo In 1970s Los Angeles, bumbling private eye Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and muscle-for-hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) become unlikely partners when they find themselves both looking for a missing woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley) following the death of a high-profile porn star. Amelia's ties to the deceased actress are unclear, but as other members of the porn industry turn up dead, March and Healy's investigation reveals a much bigger conspiracy than the duo anticipated. With help from March's teenage daughter Holly (Angourie Rice), their sleuthing eventually unearths corruption within the federal government..",7.4,"$50,000,000 (estimated)","Russell Crowe,Ryan Gosling,Angourie Rice,Matt Bomer,Margaret Qualley,Yaya DaCosta,Keith David,Beau Knapp,Lois Smith,Murielle Telio,Gil Gerard,Daisy Tahan,Kim Basinger,Jack Kilmer,Lance Valentine Butler,Ty Simpkins,Cayla Brady,Tammi Arender,Rebecca Dalton Rusk,Terence Rosemore,John L.

115,16. Paterson,2016,"A quiet observation of the triumphs and defeats of daily life, along with the poetry evident in its smallest details. Exactly one week in the life of a young man named Paterson of Paterson, New Jersey is presented. He lives an extremely regimented and routinized life, that routine perhaps most vividly displayed by the fact that he is able to wake up at exactly the same time every day without an alarm. That life includes eating Cheerios for breakfast, walking to work carrying his brown bag lunch packed in his lunch pail by his wife Laura, having a casual chat with his colleague Donny before he begins his shift driving the #23 Paterson bus for the local public transit company, walking home where he straightens out the exterior mailbox which somehow during the day gets knocked crooked, eating dinner with Laura and listening to her goings-on of the day, taking Laura's English bulldog Marvin - who he would admit to himself he doesn't much like - out for a walk to his neighborhood bar where he has one and only one beer before walking home with Marvin. There are day to day variations which are often the result of how certain other routines associated to him manifest themselves, such as what drama will occur in the relationship of Marie and Everett who are always at the bar together despite her always saying that they are no longer together, or in what form Laura's unique and distinctive design sense will affect Paterson's life directly or indirectly. Paterson's keen observances of what happens around him are largely the bases for the poems he writes, he constantly thinking of these and writing them in his secret notebook whenever he has a spare moment during his day. He is influenced by among others Paterson natives such as William Carlos Williams and his epic poem ""Paterson"". Paterson's writing are largely for himself, although Laura would like him to share more with her and the rest of the world. Something that happens to Paterson this week has the potential to knock his routinized world into a tailspin.—Huggo The film shows one week, beginning with Monday, in the life of Paterson, a bus driver from the city of Paterson, New Jersey. Every day follows much the same pattern: Paterson gets up early and goes to drive his bus, where he listens to the passengers talking and, during pauses, writes poetry in a notebook he is carrying with him. When he comes home after work he takes Marvin, his wife's dog, out for a walk and makes a stop at his bar for a beer, where he observes the other patrons and the owner, Doc, interacting.. Paterson is a bus driver in the city of Paterson, New Jersey - they share the name. Every day, Paterson adheres to a simple routine: he drives his daily route, he writes poetry into a notebook; he stops in a bar and drinks exactly one beer; he goes home to his wife, Laura. By contrast, Laura's world is ever changing. New dreams come to her almost daily. The film quietly observes the triumphs and defeats of daily life, along with the poetry evident in its smallest details.",7.3,"$5,000,000 (estimated)","Adam Driver,Golshifteh Farahani,Nellie,Rizwan Manji,Dominic Liriano,Jaden Michael,Barry Shabaka Henley,Trev Parham,Troy T.

117,18. Café Society,2016,"In the 1930s, a Bronx native moves to Hollywood and falls in love with a young woman who is seeing a married man. In 1930's Hollywood, the powerful agent, Phil Stern, is attending a party and receives a phone call from his sister living in New York. She asks for a job for her son and Phil's nephew, Bobby, who decided to move to Hollywood. Three weeks later Phil schedules a meeting with Bobby and decides to help him. He asks his secretary Veronica ""Vonnie"" to hang around with Bobby, showing him the touristic places. Bobby immediately falls in love with Vonnie, but she tells that she has a boyfriend, a journalist that travels most of the time. However, Vonnie's boyfriend is indeed a married man that is also in love with her and soon she has to make a choice between her two loves.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg) is the youngest son of a Jewish family in New York City in the 1930s; his elder sister Evelyn is a married school teacher, while his elder brother Ben is a gangster. Discontented with working for his father, a jeweler, Bobby decides to move to Hollywood, where he takes a job running menial errands for his uncle Phil (Steve Carell), a powerhouse talent agent.. It's the 1930s. From a middle class Bronx Jewish family, Bobby Dorfman and his transformation from these humble roots to being ensconced within the café society of the leisure class is shown specifically in two situations. The first is in Hollywood, where he is sent by his parents to work for his maternal Uncle Phil Stern, a powerful talent agent who he doesn't really know. Despite the difficulties in even meeting with Phil, Bobby eventually gets hired as his Joe Friday, doing whatever menial work Phil needs accomplished. But through this work, Phil exposes Bobby to the Hollywood parties where deals are made over cocktails next to the pool. Although enjoying the high life, Bobby likes to think himself above the name-dropping vacuousness of Hollywood. The second is back in New York City when Bobby starts working in the high class nightclub owned and operated by his older brother, Ben Dorfman. Although known, the Dorfmans don't generally acknowledge that Ben is really a gangster, who isn't averse to giving anyone crossing him proverbial cement shoes never to be seen again. Through these situations, Bobby's relationships with two different women named Veronica are also shown, one, more casually known as Vonnie, Uncle Phil's secretary who Bobby would consider the love of his life. A union between Bobby and Vonnie has the obstacle of she being in a relationship with a married man, who is a little closer to Bobby than he imagined when Vonnie first mentions him.—Huggo Set in the 1930s, Woody Allen's bittersweet romance follows Bronx-born Bobby Dorfman (Eisenberg) to Hollywood, where he falls in love, and back to New York, where he is swept up in the vibrant world of high society nightclub life.

Our Kind of Traitor,2016,"A couple finds themselves lured into a Russian oligarch's plans to defect, and are soon positioned between the Russian Mafia and the British Secret Service, neither of whom they can trust. When Perry and his wife, Gail, cross paths with the charismatic Dima on their Moroccan holiday, the forceful Russian is quick to challenge Perry to a friendly game of tennis. But this innocuous contest is not all it seems - Dima is a long-time servant of the Russian mafia, whose new boss, 'The Prince', wants him and his family dead. His only hope is to ask the unsuspecting Perry to broker him sanctuary with the British intelligence services, in return for exposing a vein of corruption that runs right to the heart of the City of London. Soon they find themselves on a tortuous journey through Paris to a safe house in the Swiss Alps and, with the might of the Russian mafia closing in, begin to realize this particular match has the highest stakes of all.—Potboiler Productions While on holiday in Marrakech, an ordinary English couple, Perry (McGregor) and Gail (Harris), befriend a flamboyant and charismatic Russian, Dima (Skarsgård) who unbeknownst to them is a kingpin money launderer for the Russian mafia. Based on the novel by John le Carre (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Constant Gardener). While on holiday in Marrakech, the English couple Perry and Gail meet a man called Dima, who pretends to be a Russian businessman. They cannot suspect that he is actually in the service of the Russian mafia and works as a money launderer. After an assassination attempt on one of his colleagues, he also fears for his own life and that of his children. He therefore wants to leave his previous life behind and cooperate with the British secret service. He has chosen Perry, who is as harmless as he is inconspicuous, as his intermediary. The Briton is supposed to help Dima make contact and hand over a USB stick with secret data on mafia members to MI6. Perry agrees, but quickly realizes that his task is by no means finished with the handover of the stick: Dima only wants to negotiate with MI6 if Perry is also present. Perry and Dima soon meet their contact Hector, who is to lead the operation. The two don't know if they can trust the agent at all, but he is the only option to get Dima to London unharmed. Step by step, Perry and his wife Gail get more and more caught between the fronts of the Russian mafia and MI6.",6.3,,"Carlos Acosta,Radivoje Bukvic,Stellan Skarsgård,Mariya Fomina,Dolya Gavanski,Grigory Dobrygin,Velibor Topic,Pawel Szajda,Ewan McGregor,Naomie Harris,Alec Utgoff,Marek Oravec,Mihhail Sibul,Jana Pérez,Tony Tennant,Emanuel Brook,Matthew Brook,Emily Beacock,Rosanna Beacock,Saskia Reeves,Alicia von Rittberg,Damian Lewis,Khalid Abdalla,Mark Stanley,Mark Gatiss,Katia Elizarova,Jeremy Northam,Maz Mills,Bonnafet Tarbouriech,Lucy Holt,Olivia Wheeler,Christian Brassington,Michael Gould,Emma Dewhurst,Florence Barker,Isabelle Brouwers,Elizabeth Butler,Isabelle Clough,Eleanor Ferguson,Luke Francis,Camille Guerpillon,Alice Handford,Emmeline Jansen,Valentina Karoleva,Jessie Lee,Ashlie McKimmie,Elizabeth Meadway,Danielle Nieuwenhuys,Bernadetta Pollini,Claire Richardson,Claire Rutland,Ashley Michelle Scott,Georgia Stewart,Allegra Vianello,Jasmine Wallis,Frédéric André,Mohamed Attougui,Marc Benanti,Paul Biddiss,Silvia Christie,Michelle Coverley,Marc de Panda,Madeleine Domries,Louise George,Dennis Good,Guna Gultniece,Katie Hardwick,Erick Hayden,Benjamin Hicquel,Laura Hydari,Joshua Kahan,Nikolay Karadobrev,Attila G.

Spending her time between high profile fashion establishments and the abandoned Lewis' house in Paris, Maureen is silently battling with the gut-wrenching grief and sorrow, while at the same time, looking for a sign from her deceased brother after an oath taken between the twins. Aloof, disoriented and still mourning, wraithlike Maureen attuned to the ethereal realm, is inevitably caught between this world and the spiritual, always looking for portals and a sign that would prove her brother right, however, in vain. Unexpectedly, as the days pass by swiftly and the random apparitions become more frequent, Maureen will start to receive strange text messages from an unknown sender who seems to know a lot about her, but in the end, if there is still no sign of the beloved Lewis, is there any point in waiting?—Nick Riganas Maureen Cartwright works as a personal fashion shopper for an egotistical celebrity named Kyra. It is a job she dislikes for a boss she dislikes, who she rarely sees, but it is a job which allows Maureen to stay in Paris, where she feels she needs to be at least in the short term. Maureen's twin brother, Lewis, recently died from a heart attack. Maureen suffers from the same genetic heart defect that led to Lewis' death, it is a condition which is manageable in that it need not be a death sentence. Maureen and Lewis are/were also mediums, they not only having a spiritual connection to each other, but to the spirit world, although Maureen admits that she more often followed Lewis who was more attuned to his abilities. They made a pact that whoever died first would send a sign to the other about the afterlife. Lewis' partner, Lara, wants to sell her and Lewis' Paris house to couple friends of theirs, they who want some indication before they buy that Lewis is all right with them moving in and/or that he is not haunting the house. In doing Lewis and Lara's friends and Lara the favor of spending a night in the house for this purpose, Maureen hopes that Lewis may send her that sign. As Maureen continues on with her life, she begins to experience things that she is uncertain are real which could/would mean that someone sinister is toying with her, coded signs from Lewis, something else and/or a combination of the above, the actual source of what she is experiencing which would dictate how she should react.—Huggo",6.1,"$6,000,000 (estimated)","Kristen Stewart,Lars Eidinger,Sigrid Bouaziz,Anders Danielsen Lie,Ty Olwin,Hammou Graïa,Nora Waldstätten,Benjamin Biolay,Audrey Bonnet,Pascal Rambert,Aurélia Petit,Olivia Ross,Thibault Lacroix,Calypso Valois,Benoit Peverelli,Dan Belhassen,Leo Haidar,Mickaël Laplack,Vianney Duault,Célia Ouallouche,Khaled Rawahi,Julie Rouart,Monika Bastová,Jakup Stritezsky,Charlotte Caussarieu,Charles Gillibert,Christina Konstantinidis,David Bowles,Natasa Novotna,Iris Müller-Westermann,Helmut Zander,Pamela Betsy Cooper,Abigail Millar,Fabrice Reeves,Akil Wingate",R,Olivier Assayas,"IFC Films,Mongrel Media,Metrodome Distribution,Les Films du Losange,Filmcoopi Zürich,Filmladen,The Searchers,The Searchers,Weltkino Filmverleih,Shooting Stars,Kurmaca Film,iQIYI,Bravos Pictures,Challan,Pioneer Films,CDI Films,Canibal Networks,Cine Canibal,Hakka Distribution,Imovision,MegaCom Film (MCF),Remain In Light,Rialto Distribution,StraDa Films - Seven Films,Academy 2,Fivia/Cenex,Icon Film Distribution,La Aventura,Leopardo Filmes,Shaw Organisation,The Criterion Channel,The Criterion Collection,The Criterion Collection,Tohokushinsha Film Corporation (TFC),Transeuropa Video Entertainment (TVE),UPHE Content Group,Universum Film (UFA),Weltkino Filmverleih","CG Cinéma,Vortex Sutra,Sirena Film,Detailfilm,Arte France Cinéma,ARTE,Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR),ARTE,Canal+,Ciné+,SCOPE Invest","Drama,Mystery,Thriller",105

Mike and Dave willingly go along with the directive in doing anything for Jeanie for who they have always acted as protectors.

When purgers forced them into the streets of DC, they struggle to survive the night before the purge ends in 7am with the NFFA after them.—hjon-65461 In Washington, Senator Charlie Roan is disputing the Presidential election running against the New Founding Fathers' candidate Minister Edwidge Owens (Kyle Secor). She claims that the NFFA uses The Purge with economical purpose to get rid of poor and sick people and is the favorite to win. The BFFA leaders plot a scheme revoking the protection of government officials to kill Roan. Her chief of security Leo Barnes uses his agents and snipers to protect Roan, but there is a breach in the security system created by two agents that betray Barnes and a paramilitary group breaks in the house killing the loyal agents and snipers. However Barnes and Roan succeeds in escaping but Barnes is shot on the shoulder. They are captured by a group of Russian tourists and rescued by two locals that are protecting a store. They call their friends and they decide to protect the Senator until the next day. Will they succeed in protecting Roan?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A young Charlene ""Charlie"" Roan and her family are tied up by a masked purger. He taunts them with his ""purge playlist"", and then tells them they will play a final purge game called ""Mommy's Choice.""

Eighteen years later, Roan is a U.S. Senator campaigning for the U.S. Presidency, promising to end the annual purge nights. Former police sergeant Leo Barnes is now head of security for Roan. The New Founding Fathers of America's (NFFA) leader, Caleb Warrens and their candidate, Minister Edwidge Owens, view Roan as a threat; in the guise of regaining the public's trust, revoke immunity for rank 10 or higher government officials to kill her on Purge night..",6.0,"$10,000,000 (estimated)","Frank Grillo,Elizabeth Mitchell,Mykelti Williamson,J.J.

172,23. Undrafted,2016,"When twelve ragtag teammates set out to play what should be a meaningless summer intramural baseball game, it ends up becoming the most important game of their lives. When 12 ragtag teammates set out to play what should be a meaningless summer intramural baseball game, it ends up becoming the most important game of their lives. This collection of characters--the reliever turned starting pitcher (Tyler Hoechlin), a hot-dog power hitter (Chace Crawford), an outfielder with anger management issues (Joe Mazzello), a player coach with clipboard envy (Duke Davis Roberts), an over-eager catcher (Ryan Pinkston), the old guy who shouldn't be playing anymore (Philip Winchester), and the guy everyone forgot was on the team (Matt Bush)--truly gives new meaning to the phrase ""amateur status."" As they struggle to transition away from baseball and towards an uncertain future, the best player among them (Aaron Tveit)--who they all felt should have gotten drafted--must deal with the news that his big-league dreams were dashed, leaving him grappling with why he should still play. One game can be just another box score, but when it's played by a team galvanized around the love of the game, and for the pride they have in each other, it can define a lifetime. Written and directed by Joe Mazzello (""Jurassic Park,"" HBO's ""The Pacific,"" ""The Social Network""), ""Undrafted"" is based on the real-life experiences of Joe's brother, a collegiate baseball star who was skipped over in the Major League Baseball draft.—Vertical Entertainment One week after the end of the regular season in what is ostensibly a Southern California baseball beer league (or ice-cream league as the case may be), the D-Backs are entering into the first game of the post-season against the Bulldogs, who they should have no trouble beating. The D-Backs are comprised of a loosely-defined group of friends who individually have a wide variation of skill, talent and commitment (or lack thereof), both to the game and to the team. Each team member is facing his own demon in terms of the game of baseball and his place on the team. Upon arriving at the field, they find that under the league rules unknown to them, the Bulldogs have stacked their team with a bunch of ringers who were nowhere to be seen within the league at the end of the regular season. In addition, the Bulldogs have devised a method to get under the skin of the D-Backs, especially those who are already having troubles fighting their demons. Hanging over the D-Backs this day is the fact that the highly anticipated drafting into the MLB of who is their best player, Maz, did not happen, the draft just having happened before Maz arrives at the field. This combination of items has the potential to be an explosive mix, leading to what should have been a meaningless game in the big scheme of their lives into a need to prove themselves as individuals and as a team.—Huggo",6.3,N/A,"Matt Barr,Jim Belushi,Casey Bond,Robert Curtis Brown,Michael Bunin,Matt Bush,Eddie Coleman,Michael Consiglio,Chace Crawford,Don DiPetta,Jim DeAngelo,Michael Fishman,Billy Gardell,Jay Hayden,Toby Hemingway,Tyler Hoechlin,Austin Kane,Joseph Mazzello,John Mazzello,Manny Montana,Ryan Pinkston,David Del Rio,Duke Davis Roberts,Jonathan Runyon,Mary Elizabeth Runyon,Chris Roark,Aaron Tveit,Philip Winchester,Wolfe Coleman,Lee Ellis,Justin Fiore,Zach Green,Michael Guillod,Bruster Phoenix Sampson,Renne Araujo,Kimberley Datnow,Jack Gamero,Sarah Grace Hart,Katarina Hughes,Philipp Maximilian,Brian Nicholas Perez,Shelly Ro,Amanda Samoyloff,Anna B.

175,1. La La Land,2016,"When Sebastian, a pianist, and Mia, an actress, follow their passion and achieve success in their respective fields, they find themselves torn between their love for each other and their careers. Aspiring actress serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and jazz musician Sebastian scrapes by playing cocktail-party gigs in dingy bars. But as success mounts, they are faced with decisions that fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart.—Eirini The story of aspiring actress Mia and dedicated jazz musician Sebastian, who struggle to make ends meet while pursuing their dreams in a city known for destroying hopes and breaking hearts. With modern-day Los Angeles as the backdrop, this musical about everyday life explores what more important: a once-in-a-lifetime love or the spotlight.—Jwelch5742 In Hollywood, Mia and Sebastian are struggling to make it in their respective respective careers, about which each has extreme passion. Mia is an actress who dropped out of college and moved from small-town Nevada five years ago to pursue her dream. She is enamored with old-tome Hollywood - the movies she grew up on - but hates the cattle-herding feeling of going on auditions and her belief that she needs to schmooze at social events to get ahead in the business. Sebastian is a jazz pianist, his style of jazz in the vein of traditionalists Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk. He wants to do his part to preserve that tradition, especially as he knows that that style of music is dying. He has trouble emotionally playing music he doesn't like just to get a paying gig. He dreams of opening his own jazz club, most specifically in what used to be a famous jazz club that has since been converted to a tapas-bar-cum-salsa-dance-club. Partly because of their individual struggles and partly because of the situations, their first few chance meetings are antagonistic. But they eventually become attracted to each other largely because of the passion for their dreams that they see in each other. But there are many obstacles to a happily-ever-after. They may be able to endure the struggling-artist life for so long before those struggles take their toll. The pursuit of their individual dreams may take all their energies with nothing left for their relationship. And any compromise each may make in getting ahead may change the person with whom each has fallen in love.—Huggo In sun-kissed Los Angeles, a pair of morning commuters jammed on a wide stretch of highway are off to a rocky start. But suave Sebastian, a charming jazz pianist whom life's got him on the ropes, and lovely Mia, a brilliant playwright waiting for her big break, are meant for each other. On the one hand, Sebastian thinks he has a serious plan for the future. On the other hand, Mia squanders herself in meaningless auditions, mesmerised by old Hollywood glamour. However, as the incurable romantics keep running into each other under the city's starry nights and plum-hued sunrises, a magical, old-school tap-dance romance timidly begins. Such is the power of effervescent love: it inspires people to have long walks while gazing at the colourful Milky Way of the city's flickering lights. But life is as exciting as it is challenging. After all, no one knows what tomorrow holds. And as the young idealists veer from their dreams, questions arise. Does true love exist only in movies? Do dreams come true in real life?—Nick Riganas",8.0,"$30,000,000 (estimated)","Ryan Gosling,Emma Stone,Amiee Conn,Terry Walters,Thom Shelton,Cinda Adams,Callie Hernandez,Jessica Rothe,Sonoya Mizuno,Rosemarie DeWitt,J.K.

Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse. It feels good to be bad...Assemble a team of the world's most dangerous, incarcerated Super Villains, provide them with the most powerful arsenal at the government's disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic, insuperable entity. U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller has determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose will do. However, once they realize they weren't picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it's every man for himself?—ahmetkozan A secret government agency, led by the ruthless, high-ranking official Amanda Waller, recruits some of the most dangerous, incarcerated villains on the planet to execute dangerous black ops missions and save the world from a potentially apocalyptic threat from a mysterious, supernatural entity. If anything goes wrong on this mission, the government will not be liable but rather can place the blame on the villains, who are inherently evil people. A small bomb is implanted in each member of the squad's neck with the capability of detonating any time one of the members tries to rebel or escape. It will be up to this assembled team of villains to prevail over the seemingly impossible events that will unfold before them, in what many deem to be a ""suicide mission"".—Kyle Perez With Superman dead, the world needs a new band of superheroes to step into the breach. Senior US Intelligence officer Amanda Waller comes up with a daring plan - use extreme criminals with special abilities to fight crime, in exchange for them receiving reduced sentences.

177,3. War Dogs,2016,"Loosely based on the true story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, who won a three hundred million dollar contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan. In 2005, David Packouz lives in Miami, Florida, working as a massage therapist and living with his girlfriend Iz. Desiring an additional source of income, David spends his life savings on high-quality Egyptian cotton sheets, planning to sell them to Miami retirement homes, but this venture fails to produce results. At a funeral for a friend, David runs into his best from high school, friend Efraim Diveroli, who had moved to Los Angeles some years prior to work with his uncle selling guns. Efraim has left his uncle and formed his own company, AEY, which fills orders for arms placed by the US government due to the ongoing war in Iraq. David's life takes another turn when his girlfriend informs him that she is pregnant. Efraim offers him a job at AEY, and even though David and Iz both vehemently oppose the war, David eventually agrees, telling his girlfriend that he has begun selling his cotton sheets to the US government through Efraim's contacts. Struggling to make ends meet working as a massage therapist in sunny 2005 Miami Beach, twentysomething, David Packouz, finds himself with his back to the wall when his supportive girlfriend, Iz, makes a life-altering announcement. Then, with the U.S. fighting in both Iraq and Afghanistan, David's long-lost high-school friend and swaggering international arms dealer, Efraim Diveroli, enters the picture, and just like that, David becomes the second-half of Efraim's lucrative weapon-selling company. Now, more and more, the pair's immoral philosophy not only is starting to pay off, but it puts their shady firm on the map; however, in this dangerous business, mistakes do happen. And that $300-million contract with the U.S. government could spell trouble for everyone involved. Is there an easy way out for the drunk-with-success war dogs?—Nick Riganas Two friends in their early 20s (Hill and Teller) living in Miami Beach during the Iraq War exploit a little-known government initiative that allows small businesses to bid on U.S. Military contracts. Starting small, they begin raking in big money and are living the high life. But the pair gets in over their heads when they land a 300 million dollar deal to arm the Afghan Military - a deal that puts them in business with some very shady people, not the least of which turns out to be the U.S. Government.

Later a woman named Gina shows up looking for medical assistance and Mae can't help but notice bruises all over her body. Mae deduces she's a battered woman and when Mae hears her being beaten, Mae asks Bishop to help her. He goes and kills the guy she's with. He kills the man and then sets fire to the boat he's on. But he sees that Gina has a photo of him. He deduces that the one who wants him, sent her. He confronts her and she admits that she works at a children's shelter in Cambodia and that someone told her if she didn't do what he said, the children would be endangered. While waiting for the man to come, they get close. And when the man's people comes, they grab them. Bishop is brought to the man who wants him to do the jobs and he tells Bishop that if he doesn't do it, Gina will be killed. So Bishop has no choice but to do it.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Living under a new secret identity, the now-retired and once-hardened elite hit-man, Arthur Bishop, has found shelter in bustling Rio de Janeiro. However--under the serious threat of being exposed by his arch-nemesis, Riah Crain--Bishop will have no other choice but to agree in performing three impossible suicide missions across the four corners of the earth, to finally get off the hook. Now, time is of the essence, as Crain's outrageous ultimatum is no joke. Undoubtedly, this assassin's killing days are not over; nevertheless, can Bishop do what he does best without losing a new-found love?—Nick Riganas After faking his death, Arthur Bishop has been living quietly in Rio DE Janeiro with the name Santos. He is approached by Renee Tran, who knows his true identity and explains that her employer wishes for Bishop to kill three targets and stage them as accidents. Seeing her mercenaries waiting nearby, Bishop makes his escape, and flees the country to Thailand. He takes shelter at the resort island beach house of his friend, Mei, and learns that Tran is working for Riah Crain.. Arthur Bishop has been living in a yacht at Marina da Gloria in Rio de Janeiro for five months after the discovery of his hideout in New Orleans. While having lunch at Sugar Loaf's restaurant, a woman comes to his table and says that her boss, Crain, wants him to kill three targets. Bishop reacts and fights several men at the restaurant, but succeeds to escape. He goes to Thailand where his friend Mei takes care of his house in an island. When Mei sees a man named Frank hitting the young woman Gina in his yacht, Mei asks Bishop to help her. He fights the man and accidentally kills him. Soon Gina tells him that Crain forced her to meet and seduce him since he wants Bishop to kill three men. They have a romance but Crain's minions attack Bishop at the beach and kidnap Gina. Now Bishop is forced to meet Crain, who is his long-time acquaintance, and to kill three men impossible to be reached to rescue Gina.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",5.7,"$40,000,000 (estimated)","Jason Statham,Jessica Alba,Tommy Lee Jones,Michelle Yeoh,Sam Hazeldine,John Cenatiempo,Toby Eddington,Femi Elufowoju Jr.,Anteo Quintavalle,Yayaying Rhatha Phongam,Bonnie Zellerbach,Stuart Thorp,Alex Kuzelicki,Brahim Chab,Thomas Kiwi,Andrew Stehlin,Francis Tonkala Tamouya,Tais Rodrigues Dias,Lynette Emond,Allan Poppleton,Tayme Thapthimthong,Soji Ikai,Vithaya Pansringarm,Chatchawan Kamonsakpitak,Atanas Srebrev,Yothin Udomsanti,Rachel O'Meara,Aaron Brumfield,Damian Mavis,Valentin Velkov,Tony Arunah Abbey,Amir Zargham,Peter Rnic,Eoin O'Brien,Alexander Winters,Armin Parvin,Yurii Chuchenko,Natalie Burn,Martin Bravo Santiago,Hare Das Ahatefu,Dylan Farrell,Greg Matt Garcia,Bobby Gerrits,Geoffrey Giuliano,Ann Krav,Viktor Krav,Tomer Oz,Suman C.

Kubo lives a quiet, normal life in a small shoreside village until a spirit from the past turns his life upside down by re-igniting an age-old vendetta. This causes all sorts of havoc as gods and monsters chase Kubo who, in order to survive, must locate a magical suit of armor once worn by his late father, a legendary Samurai warrior.

Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and his mother herself cannot recall the ending due to her mental state deteriorating.

Brandon Burlsworth is perhaps the greatest walk-on in the history of college football. Brandon had always dreamed of playing for the Arkansas Razorbacks, but was considered too short and too fat to play Division I. Undeterred, Brandon took a big risk and walked on in 1994. Written off by fellow teammates and coaches, Brandon displayed dogged determination in the face of staggering odds. An extremely devoted Christian, Brandon never cursed or drank. He was genuinely humble and low-key. He worked harder than anybody, on and off the field, becoming the first Razorback to earn a Bachelor's and Master's degree while still playing. The overly-fat kid who was once an embarrassment to his teammates and an annoyance to his coaches, ended up becoming the most respected player in the history of the program, changing the lives of all he touched. Eleven days after being drafted into the NFL, Brandon was tragically killed in a car accident, crushing all who knew him. Brandon was ""too good to be true"". How could something like that happen to this guy? The age-old question slammed down upon all with terrible force: ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" Brandon's story is more than mere football. It is the ultimate expression of the question ""Why?""

The Girl on the Train is the story of Rachel Watson's life post-divorce. Every day, she takes the train in to work in New York, and every day the train passes by her old house. The house she lived in with her husband, who still lives there, with his new wife and child. As she attempts to not focus on her pain, she starts watching a couple who live a few houses down -- Megan and Scott Hipwell. She creates a wonderful dream life for them in her head, about how they are a perfect happy family. And then one day, as the train passes, she sees something shocking, filling her with rage. The next day, she wakes up with a horrible hangover, various wounds and bruises, and no memory of the night before. She has only a feeling: something bad happened. Then come the TV reports: Megan Hipwell is missing. Rachel becomes invested in the case and trying to find out what happened to Megan, where she is, and what exactly she herself was up to that same night Megan went missing. The divorcee Rachel Watson commutes every day to New York by train and watches the old house where she lived with her husband Tom Watson through the window. Rachel is an alcoholic and infertile woman that frequently has blackouts and shares an apartment with her friend Cathy. Tom is married with Anna Boyd with the baby Evie. Their babysitter is Megan Hipwell that lives with her husband Scott in the same neighborhood in the suburb. Rachel admires Megan and Scott since she believes they are the perfect couple. However Megan is a promiscuous woman that has affairs with many men including her psychiatrist Dr. Kamal Abdic. When Rachel sees Megan kissing another man on the balcony of her house, she decides to have a conversation with Megan after drinking in a bar. However she has a blackout and awakens with bruises in her apartment. Soon she learns that Megan is missing and Detective Riley that is in charge of the investigation visits Rachel to interrogate her since the neighbors had seen an alcoholic woman wandering in the area. However Rachel does not recall what she did that night. Rachel decides to investigate the case and has dreadful discoveries about her life and Tom. Who might be the killer?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Picking up her pieces in the aftermath of her cindered marriage, once happily married Rachel, has now turned into a sad, troubled and lonely person with nothing to rely on except for the fragmented memories of a robbed life, and dolefully, her alcohol addiction. As a result, Rachel with the intention to compensate for her loneliness and to cope with the profound sadness, twice a day, she commutes by train to New York and back to Ardsley-on-Hudson, staring longingly at the houses near the tracks through her well-chosen seat's perfect view. Not long ago, one of those houses used to be hers, but now, her ex-husband with his new wife lives there, and only two doors down the road, lives Megan, a stunning blonde who seems to embody everything Rachel ever wanted to be and now it is forever lost. But then one day, when Rachel will unwillingly witness a scene taking place in Megan's porch, filled with pure rage, she will get off the train intending to intervene, only to wake up in the following morning covered in blood, bruised and completely oblivious with Megan nowhere to be found. Will Rachel manage to remember what happened yesterday?—Nick Riganas Rachel travels to and from New York each day on the train.

209,10. Moonlight,2016,"A young African-American man grapples with his identity and sexuality while experiencing the everyday struggles of childhood, adolescence, and burgeoning adulthood. Three time periods - young adolescence, mid-teen and young adult - in the life of black-American Chiron is presented. When a child, Chiron lives with his single, crack addict mother Paula in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami. Chiron is a shy, withdrawn child largely due to his small size and being neglected by his mother, who is more concerned about getting her fixes and satisfying her carnal needs than taking care of him. Because of these issues, Chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful. Besides his same aged Cuban-American friend Kevin, Chiron is given what little guidance he has in life from a neighborhood drug dealer named Juan, who can see that he is neglected, and Juan's caring girlfriend Teresa, whose home acts as a sanctuary away from the bullies and away from Paula's abuse. With this childhood as a foundation, Chiron may have a predetermined path in life, one that will only be magnified in terms of its problems when he reaches his difficult teen years when peer pressure affects what he and many of his peers do, unless he follows Juan's advice of truly making his own decisions for himself.—Huggo 1980s Miami. Labelled as ""soft"" for his walk, sensitive 9-year-old boy Chiron is an easy target. And in a cruel world of antitheses, where everything can change at the sight of a knife or a gun, society has doomed Chiron to live a hard life. But violence begets violence. Then, months turn into years, and the boy grows into an introverted 16-year-old teenager struggling with his identity. Now, only a tough facade can shield him from the world. As a result, three pivotal periods--marked by intimidation, neglect, and pale paternal figures--define Chiron, now a vulnerable young adult. But, after all these years, complex pent-up emotions still get in the way of self-discovery. However, Chiron wants to know.

210,11. Deepwater Horizon,2016,"A dramatization of the disaster in April 2010, when the offshore drilling rig called the Deepwater Horizon exploded, resulting in the worst oil spill in history. In April 2010, there is no oil exploration operation in the Gulf of Mexico to compare with the Deepwater Horizon oil rig with its size or sheer depth of its drilling. However, the project for the BP oil company is beset with technical difficulties to the point where the general operational supervisor, Jimmy Harrell, and his Chief Electrical Engineer, Mike Williams, are concerned potentially dangerous trouble is brewing. Unfortunately, visiting BP executives, frustrated by the project's long delays, order curtailed site inspections and slanted system tests to make up for lost time even as Harrell, Williams and his team helplessly protest for the sake of proper safety. On April 20, the workers' fears are realized in the worst possible way when the rig's various structural and system flaws spark a catastrophic cascade of failures that would create a massive blowout and explosion that threatens them all, even as it also begins the worst environmental disaster in US history.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) April 20, 2010. Manned by 126 crew-members, the semi-submersible, offshore oil-drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon, is free-floating over the Gulf of Mexico, 41 miles south-east of the Louisiana Coast. But, before long, Chief electronics technician, Mike Williams, and the seasoned rig supervisor, Jimmy Harrell, are shocked to discover that the standard procedure regarding the cement foundation, the only thing between the rig and a blowout, has been bypassed by orders of BP's executives, Donald Vidrine and Robert Kaluza. Clueless about the stability of the well, and whether the integrity of the concrete has been compromised or not, the greedy managers push to start pumping, intent on cutting expenses, and disaster strikes. As a result, an endless chain of malfunctions transforms the Deepwater Horizon into a blazing inferno, while Williams and Harrell heroically struggle to rescue their shipmates in the worst oil disaster in the U.S. history that lasted 87 nightmarish days.—Nick Riganas On April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon, an oil drilling rig operated by private contractor Transocean, is set to begin drilling off the southern coast of Louisiana on behalf of BP.

Sully,2016,"When pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger lands his damaged plane on the Hudson River in order to save the flight's passengers and crew, some consider him a hero while others think he was reckless. On January 15, 2009, flight 1549 left New York City, but shortly after taking off there's an accident that wrecks the plane's engines. They were told to return to the airport, but pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger decides that the plane won't make it to the airport, so he chooses to land in the Hudson River. And even when none of the passengers were seriously injured, Sully finds himself under intense scrutiny by the National Transportation Safety Board (N.T.S.B.), whose investigation reveals that the plane could have made it to the airport and one of the engines was still working. Sully still maintains the engines were out and if they tried to go to the airport, they would have crashed.—rcs0411@yahoo.com On January 15, 2009, after a bird strike with the loss of two turbines, pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and co-pilot Jeff Skiles land an Airbus A320 with one hundred fifty-five passengers on the Hudson River saving their lives. Sully is claimed a hero by the press and public. However, the official investigation reports that the left engine was running at idle and not damaged, and the flight simulator indicates that it would have been possible to land at LaGuardia or Teterboro. Sully has to defend himself to the commission; otherwise he has to defend his reputation and career showing new evidence of the incident. Will he succeed?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The Miracle on the Hudson, that is pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landing his damaged jet plane on the Hudson River and saving all one hundred fifty-five people on-board from a horrible fate, is seen as an incredible act of heroism from the dedicated pilot. However, the National Transportation Safety Board seeks to ruin Sully's career by claiming the fact that his jet plane still had enough altitude and thrust to return to a safe airport in New York City. Will Sully be adored as a hero or a fraud?—Eric On January 15, 2009, the fateful U.S. Airways Flight 1549 suffered catastrophic damage shortly after take-off, losing both engines. Only three minutes into the flight, and at an approximate altitude of eight hundred fifty-three metres, the experienced pilot, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, and co-pilot, Jeff Skiles, had to make a split-second decision: should they try to land the crippled Airbus A320 on the LaGuardia Airport or Teterboro? Instead, they attempted an emergency landing on the freezing waters of the Hudson River, saving the lives of all one hundred fifty-five passengers and crew. However, even though Sully was hailed a hero, the National Transportation Safety Board thought otherwise, as sophisticated computer simulations suggested that Sully could have landed the plane elsewhere.

225,1. The Accountant,2016,"As a math savant uncooks the books for a new client, the Treasury Department closes in on his activities, and the body count starts to rise. Christian Wolff is a math savant with more affinity for numbers than people. Behind the cover of a small-town CPA office, he works as a freelance accountant for some of the world's most dangerous criminal organizations. With the Treasury Department's Crime Enforcement Division, run by Ray King, starting to close in, Christian takes on a legitimate client: a state-of-the-art robotics company where an accounting clerk has discovered a discrepancy involving millions of dollars. But as Christian uncooks the books and gets closer to the truth, it is the body count that starts to rise.—Happy_Evil_Dude Christian Wolff is an efficient accountant that is usually hired to find financial deceptions and embezzlement for criminal organizations. His point of contact is a woman's voice by phone and the means of payment are sometimes valuable paintings or gold bars instead of money. Christian was an autistic child that received a rigid military training with his brother Braxton from their paranoid military father. The director of the Treasury Department, Raymond ""Ray"" Kinghas, been unsuccessfully hunting The Accountant for a long period and he blackmails the efficient analyst Marybeth Medina to identify who he is before his retirement. When the accountant, Dana Cummings, finds an embezzlement of 61 million-dollars in the Living Robotics, Christian is hired to audit the company by the owner Lamar Blackburn and his sister Rita Blackburn. The financial director Ed Chilton tells that Dana committed a mistake but soon Christian checks the books and confirms the embezzlement. During the night, Chilton is murdered, as if he had committed suicide, and Lamar finishes the audit affecting the fact that Christian has not finished his work. Soon Dana and Christian are hunted down by hitmen and Christian protects her. Meanwhile Medina finds his true identity and Christian is hunted by Ray and the FBI. Who might be the person behind the embezzlement?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The U.S. Treasury Department is searching for a man who is the accountant to several global crime figures. They know him simply as The Accountant. The man himself is living a fairly inconspicuous existence as a practicing accountant. He is hired by Living Robotics, a tech firm, to go through their accounts after a junior accountant found some abnormalities. What he finds makes him a marked man.—grantss Christian Wolff, only the latest alias he has used over the course of his life, owns and operates his own small accounting firm in Plainfield, Illinois. He is a high level autistic, who is able to control his need for strict order, routine, and the completion of tasks, and his natural inability to tolerate extreme external stimuli, through medication and a daily regimen designed to withstand such. His father, an Army colonel, made him and his younger brother, one of the few people to who he has always had a natural affinity, go through extreme physical and mental training, such as in the martial arts, when they were children so that they could defend themselves against any bullying specifically against Chris. Chris is also a savant when it comes to numbers, mathematics and spotting discrepancies in order. While Chris does have some legitimate accounting clients in Plainfield, his storefront is largely just a cover for how he makes most of his wealth - which is vast - as a forensic accounting consultant, usually to criminal organizations who are looking for any internal discrepancies i.e. if anyone on the inside is skimming off the top. On the advice of his unseen female associate, with who he communicates solely via electronic means, Chris takes a legitimate consulting job with Living Robotics, founded and still owned and run by Lamar Blackburn and his sister Rita, when one of their low level accountants, Dana Cummings, notices what she believes are some discrepancies in the company's financials over the course of years. Unknown to Chris when he accepts this job, his taking it, places his and Dana's lives in jeopardy, she another of those few people in life to whom he has a natural affinity, which may not be obvious on the surface due to his difficulty in social interaction. Upon learning that his and Dana's lives are at risk, Chris decides his self-appointed mission, against his regimen and routine, is to protect Dana at all cost, and figuratively - or literally if the opportunity arises - to put a bullet through the head of whoever has contracted the hit on them. Added to the complication of the situation is that Ray King, the highly successful director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) at the Treasury Department, has assigned his most talented analyst Marybeth Medina to track down the man coined The Accountant who is known to work for crime organizations, the only real lead being The Accountant's photographs - none with a clear face shot - with known crime bosses, and another former alias used, Louis Carroll. King is clear that Medina's career is on the line if she is unsuccessful. While this assignment is outwardly working toward the goals of FinCEN, King has ulterior motives for wanting Medina specifically to track down The Accountant which he does not tell her.—Huggo",7.3,"$44,000,000 (estimated)","Ben Affleck,Anna Kendrick,J.K.

From the creators of Shrek comes the most smart, funny, irreverent animated comedy of the year, DreamWorks' Trolls. This holiday season, enter a colorful, wondrous world populated by hilariously unforgettable characters and discover the story of the overly optimistic Trolls, with a constant song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomach. Featuring original music from Justin Timberlake, and soon-to-be classic mash-ups of songs from other popular artists, the film stars the voice talents of Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Russell Brand, James Corden, Kunal Nayyar, Ron Funches, Icona Pop, Gwen Stefani, and many more.

The Trolls are small creatures who live in an almost perpetual state of happiness, singing, dancing and hugging all day. However, they are discovered by the Bergens, large miserable creatures, who can feel happy only after eating a Troll. The Bergens imprison the trolls and eat them every year on a special occasion, called Trollstice. The Trolls, led by their king, King Peppy, with his baby daughter, Princess Poppy, escape through underground tunnels on the day of Trollstice, when Prince Gristle Jr. was going to eat his first Troll. Enraged, Gristle Jr.'s father King Gristle Sr. banishes his Chef who was in charge of the Trollstice preparation. 20 years later, (at the age of 20) Poppy throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape, despite the fears and warnings of the gray troll, Branch, that loud parties will attract the Bergens. A Zen troll named Creek, who is Poppy's boyfriend, arrives and tells Branch to start being happy instead of being grumpy; Branch refuses. At the party, Branch's fears come true, when Chef sees the fireworks and kidnaps Guy Diamond, Biggie with Mr. Dinkles, Fuzzbert, Smidge, Satin with Chenille, D.J. Suki, Cooper, and Creek (which Poppy tried to rescue).

The Lost City of Z tells the incredible true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett, who journeys into the Amazon at the dawn of the 20th century and discovers evidence of a previously unknown, advanced civilization that may have once inhabited the region. Despite being ridiculed by the scientific establishment who regard indigenous populations as ""savages,"" the determined Fawcett - supported by his devoted wife, son and aide de camp returns time and again to his beloved jungle in an attempt to prove his case, culminating in his mysterious disappearance in 1925. In 1905, British Army Major Percy Fawcett is ordered by the Royal Geographical Society to venture out to a grand adventure at the uncharted and dense Bolivian jungles to act as a referee and map out the borders with Brazil. Anxiously, Fawcett, resting his reputation entirely on the venture's success as the son of a disgraced ex-military man, together with aide-de-camp Henry Costin, will set off on a dangerous mission to Amazonia, where apart from the starvation, the infernal heat, the hostile indigenous Indian tribes and the wild animals, they will also find evidence of advanced, non-white civilizations. Determined to find the impossible and the ultimate missing piece of the human puzzle, the Lost City of Z, the ambitious Fawcett will visit the lush Amazonian jungles again and again in hopes of getting closer to his dream up until his equally mysterious and ungracious disappearance near 1925.—Nick Riganas Ireland, 1905: Percy Fawcett is a young British officer participating in a stag hunt on an Irish baronial estate for the benefit of the visiting Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.

Fawcett agrees to lead the survey party to restore his family's good name. Aboard a ship to Brazil, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin, who has knowledge of the Amazon rain-forest. At a large rubber plantation in the jungle owned by the Portuguese nobleman Baron DE Gondoris, the two meet Corporal Arthur Manley, who tells them that the British government advises against further exploration. Fawcett, with several guides and the Amazonian scout Tadjui, completes the mission. Tadjui tells Fawcett stories about a jungle city covered in gold and full of people. Fawcett dismisses such stories as insane ravings, but discovers highly advanced broken pottery and some small stone statues in the jungle that convince him of the veracity of Tadjui's story..

Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life,2016,"After his new principal Dwight destroys his sketchbook, Rafe Khatchadorian and his best friend Leo decide to metaphorically destroy Dwight's book by breaking every rule in the school's Code of Conduct. Quiet, imaginative teenager Rafe Katchadorian is tired of his middle school's obsession with the rules at the expense of any and all creativity. Desperate to shake things up, Rafe and his best friend Leo come up with a plan: break every single rule in the school and let the students run wild.—CBS Films Budding young artist Rafe transfers to a new middle school, where the rules-obsessed principal quickly punishes him for his failure to conform by destroying a book of his drawings. Rafe then decides to fight back by playing pranks and breaking every rule in the school. Rafe Khatchadorian, with a passion for art and an incredible imagination, transfers mid-year to Hills Village Middle School after being kicked out of his previous one. On his first day, he meets strict, exceedingly vain Principal Ken Dwight and his obsequious Vice-Principal, Ida Stricker. Dwight runs the school with an iron fist and forces students to comply with an extensive list of rules that are mostly senseless while Stricker follows along with his antics. Later that day, an assembly focused on the BaseLine Assessment of Academic Readiness standardized test, led enthusiastically by Dwight, is interrupted when another student grabs Rafe's sketchbook in which he had humorously drawn the principal as a zombie repeating ""B.L.A.A.R."" over and over.

239,15. 20th Century Women,2016,"In 1979 Santa Barbara, Dorothea is a determined single mother who is raising her son, Jamie. Dorothea enlists the help of two women -- Abbie, a free-spirited punk artist and Julie, a savvy teenager -- to help with Jamie's upbringing. Love, life, and the struggles of a mother bringing up a son in the late 70's. The ignorance of a free spirit against the needs of a young man trying to find his true character and beliefs. Living in a bohemian household shared with three like minded spirited people to help pay the rent, his mother tries to establish bonds that he cannot deal with. She cannot deal with his inability to talk, and enlists the help of other females in his life to share the burden of his upbringing. Slowly life unravels for them all without understanding how. In spite of their perceived struggles, they all go on to live defined lives without any serious consequences.—Peter Cox 1979, Santa Barbara. Long divorced fifty-five year old chain smoker Dorothea Fields, a product of wanting to work during the war years, is an independently and liberally minded draftsperson. She has not had a steady man in her life since the divorce. Despite having a plethora of other people in their lives as Dorothea's answer to almost every situation is to invite people over for dinner, she and her fifteen year old son, Jamie Fields, are the only other biological family each has per se in a meaningful way. Dorothea wants to give Jamie as much freedom and responsibility as possible to make informed decisions and mistakes from which to learn. As Jamie is at the age of transitioning into a grown-up and as she doesn't recognize her son anymore as he is a teen of his day (the punk music about which she is truly mystified), Dorothea is still concerned, without that male influence, that he won't turn into the adult she would want. As Jamie and their male boarder William, an Earth child who is tasked with doing the renovations on their house, haven't really bonded in that buddy/buddy or father figure way, Dorothea turns to two other women in their lives to help her provide guidance to Jamie through this transition period. One is their other boarder, twenty-four year old Abbie Porter, an aspiring photographer, who is an inherently sad woman out of her own life confusion, and an avowed feminist. Two is Jamie's best friend since childhood, seventeen year old Julie Hamlin, who he's loved all his life and with who he has wanted to have sex ever since he hit puberty. The daughter of a therapist who forces her to be a participant in her teen group therapy sessions, Julie has long been sexually active, albeit not with Jamie, the sex about which she is rather nonchalant in liking it sometimes, and not liking it others. This situation with this collective is as much about each person's development at this phase in their life with these other people as it is about Jamie becoming a responsible male adult, especially as he too is concerned about his mother, who, despite her independence, he feels has not moved on since the divorce.—Huggo",7.3,"$7,000,000 (estimated)","Annette Bening,Elle Fanning,Greta Gerwig,Billy Crudup,Lucas Jade Zumann,Alison Elliott,Thea Gill,Vitaly Andrew LeBeau,Olivia Hone,Waleed Zuaiter,Curran Walters,Darrell Britt-Gibson,Alia Shawkat,Nathalie Love,Cameron Protzman,Victoria Bruno,John Billingsley,Cameron Gellman,Finnegan Seeker Bell,Zoë Nanos,Lauren Foley,Gareth Williams,J.

252,3. The Founder,2016,"The story of Ray Kroc, a salesman who turned two brothers' innovative fast food eatery, McDonald's, into the biggest restaurant business in the world, with a combination of ambition, persistence, and ruthlessness. 1954. Having worked as a salesman most of his adult life, Ray Kroc has been a hustler in most senses of the word. That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethel's heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her as he does in selling; his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald's Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick's initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray's experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for ""his"" business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities.—Huggo In 1954, Ray Kroc is an unsuccessful traveling salesman selling Prince Castle brand milkshake-mixers. While he has a supportive wife, Ethel, and has saved enough to live a simple and comfortable life in Arlington Heights, Illinois, he craves more. Ray also observes that many of the drive-in restaurants that he tries to sell to are inefficiently run, with a long waiting time for orders and carhops more concerned with avoiding the groping from greasers than getting the orders right. After learning that a drive-in in San Bernardino is ordering an unusually large number of milkshake mixers, Ray drives to California to see it. What he finds is McDonald's: a highly popular walk-up restaurant with fast service, high-quality food, disposable packaging, and a family-friendly atmosphere. Impressed by the revolutionary Speedee Service System of American brothers, Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald, over-the-hill 52-year-old milkshake-machine salesman Ray Kroc, drives to their small drive-in restaurant in 1954 San Bernardino, California. After tasting a fresh, scrumptious, 15-cent hamburger from grill to counter in just 30 seconds and learning all about the ingenious brothers' secret of success, Ray Kroc has an epiphany: what if the business of the innovative duo was franchised? As one thing leads to another and Ray manages to strike a business deal with the McDonald brothers, what follows next is a tale of hard work, persistence, and determination, peppered with equal amounts of manipulation, ruthlessness, and greed. In an increasingly competitive world, just how far is one willing to go to seize a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?—Nick Riganas",7.2,"$25,000,000 (estimated)","Michael Keaton,Nick Offerman,John Carroll Lynch,Linda Cardellini,B.J.

253,4. Silence,2016,"In the 17th century, two Portuguese Jesuit priests travel to Japan in an attempt to locate their mentor, who is rumored to have committed apostasy, and to propagate Catholicism. Intent on investigating the truth behind Father Cristovão Ferreira's abrupt end of correspondence, the devout Portuguese Catholic priests, Sebastião Rodrigues and Francisco Garupe, set off to Japan, in 1633. In great disbelief, as the rumours of Ferreira's apostasy still echo in their minds, the zealous Jesuit missionaries try to locate their mentor, amid the bloodshed of the violent anti-Christian purges. Under those circumstances, the two men and the Japanese guide, Kichijiro, arrive in Japan, only to witness firsthand the unbearable burden of those who have a different belief in a land founded on tradition. Now--as the powerful Grand Inquisitor, Inoue, performs hideous tortures on the brave Japanese Christians--Father Rodrigues will soon have to put his faith to the ultimate test: renounce it in exchange for the prisoners' lives. There, in the ends of the world, a subtle change has begun; however, why is God's silence so deafening?—Nick Riganas In the seventeenth century, in Portugal, the Portuguese Jesuit priests Sebastião Rodrigues and Francisco Garupe ask permission to Father Alessandro Valignano to travel to Japan to investigate the rumors that their mentor Father Cristóvão Ferreira had committed apostasy abandoning his Catholic faith after being tortured by the shogunate. They meet the alcoholic fisherman Kichijiro that agrees to guide them to Japan. When they arrive at a small village, they learn that the Christians residents live hidden in caves since the Inquisitor kills any villager suspect to be Christian. Along the days, Rodrigues and Garupel propagate Catholicism among the villagers and try to find a lead to Ferreira. But when the Inquisitor arrives in the village with his men, the lives of the residents and the priests will change.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The young Portuguese Jesuit priest Cristóvão Ferreira witnesses the mortal torture of five missionaries. The priest is helpless in the presence of Japanese authorities conducting the torture to try to assist his colleagues in any way. A few years later, at St. Paul's College, Macau, an Italian Jesuit priest, Alessandro Valignano, receives news that Ferreira renounced his faith in Japan after being tortured. In disbelief, Ferreira's Portuguese pupils, Jesuit priests Sebastião Rodrigues and Francisco Garupe, set off to find him.

As the investigation continues, the Tsarnaev brothers realize that the authorities are close to identifying them and attempt to flee the city to continue their fanatical mayhem.

275,2. Hidden Figures,2016,"Three female African-American mathematicians play a pivotal role in astronaut John Glenn's launch into orbit while dealing with racial and gender discrimination. As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, NASA found untapped talent in a group of female African-American mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history. Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women known as ""human computers"", follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds specifically tasked with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Goble Johnson crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes.—20th Century Fox Approximately one year (early 1961 to early 1962)--the height of the American-Soviet space race--in the life of three female friends, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, who worked in the female African-American computing section of NASA at Langley, is presented. Their largely-unheralded-at-the-time contributions to the advancement of the American space program are dramatized, contributions which they were able to achieve despite facing both gender and race issues, the latter as much of the US, including NASA, was still segregated. Mary Jackson, assigned to the space-capsule heat-shield team, is encouraged by one of the engineers on the team to apply for one of the more senior engineering positions, as he recognizes her expertise. In what ends up being the Catch-22, Mary lacks the necessary qualifications for the promotion and cannot get those qualifications as the extension courses are not taught in any high school accessible to African-Americans in Hampton, where she lives. Her struggles are exacerbated by her husband Levi Jackson, a civil rights activist who only sees the advancement of African-Americans in a narrow view. Dorothy Vaughan has been acting supervisor of the section, only having the responsibilities but not the title or the associated pay. Dorothy believes not getting that promotion is largely the doing of her Caucasian supervisor, Vivian Mitchell. With the first IBM mainframe computer just having been purchased at NASA, Dorothy, with the odds stacked against her, tries to learn as much as she can on her own about its workings to make herself and the entire African-American female computing section relevant in this changing time. And widowed mother Katherine Goble is the mathematical genius whose expertise in analytical geometry gets her assigned to the Space Task Group under the lead of Al Harrison, a no nonsense man who wants the job done at any cost. To get to Harrison, Katherine must go through lead engineer Paul Stafford, who sees her as an irrelevant underling and keeps falling on the excuse of clearance to quash Katherine's ability to do her job effectively. Her burgeoning romance with National Guardsman Jim Johnson, which got a rocky start, is also dramatized.—Huggo The untold story of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson: brilliant African-American women working at NASA and serving as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit.

Two of the mercenaries, William and Tovar, are captured by the local army, called the Nameless Order, who house them within the confines of the Great Wall. The Nameless Order informs them that the creature is called a Tao Tei, as a species who attack once every sixty years, this one specimen killed by William signifying their imminent attack. Tao Tei's survival is predicated on the soldier creatures gathering food to bring back to the Queen as nourishment. Although not stated to them explicitly, William and Tovar learn from Ballard, another westerner at the Wall, that they will be treated well but are not allowed ever to leave in the Nameless Order protecting the secrets of the Wall, Ballard who, like them, was a mercenary in search of black powder, he captured twenty-five years ago. As the Tao Tei initiate their attack, the Nameless Order executes their strategic defense, with most of their measures based on their position of the fortress that is the Great Wall. In viewing what is happening, William and Tovar begin to diverge in their thoughts: Tovar, with Ballard, sees the current turmoil as the perfect opportunity to escape stealing as much of the black powder that the Nameless Order has that they can carry, while William, seeing a new purpose in life in learning about trust from Commander Lin Mae, wants to stay and fight with the Nameless Order, it not a certainty that any of them being able to survive regardless of the path they take. This divergence places William and Tovar at odds with each other in carrying out their chosen paths.—Huggo",5.9,"$150,000,000 (estimated)","Matt Damon,Tian Jing,Willem Dafoe,Andy Lau,Pedro Pascal,Hanyu Zhang,Han Lu,Kenny Lin,Eddie Peng,Xuan Huang,Ryan Zheng,Karry Wang,Cheney Chen,Pilou Asbæk,Numan Acar,Johnny Cicco,Vicky Yu,Bing Liu,Stephen Chang",PG-13,Yimou Zhang,"Andes Films,B&H Film Distribution,China Film Group Corporation (CFGC),CinemArt,Columbia Pictures,Finnkino,Toho-Towa,United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures,Universal Pictures Argentina,Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures,Universal Pictures,3+,4+,9Go!,ATV,Amazon Instant Video,Amazon Prime Video,Film1,Google Play,MUBI,MagentaTV,Maxdome Store,Maxdome,Puls 4,RTL Zwei,RTL,RTL2,Rakuten TV,SBS9,Sky Cinema +1,Sky Cinema +24,Sky Cinema Action,Sky Cinema Hits,Sky Cinema,Sky Store,TV24,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (UPHE),Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (UPHE),Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment,Universal Pictures,Universal Pictures,VOX,Videoload,Warner TV Film,Warner TV Serie,Youtube Filme & TV,Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF),iTunes","Legendary East,Atlas Entertainment,China Film Co., Ltd.,Dentsu,Fuji Television Network,Kava Productions,Le Vision Pictures,Legendary Entertainment","Action,Adventure,Fantasy,Thriller",103

Through a revolutionary technology that unlocks his genetic memories, Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) experiences the adventures of his ancestor, Aguilar de Nerha, in 15th Century Spain. Callum discovers he is descended from a mysterious secret society, the Assassins, and amasses incredible knowledge and skills to take on the oppressive and powerful Templar organization in the present day.—ahmetkozan A man named Callum Lynch is sentenced to death by lethal injection in Texas. However, the Abstergo Company fakes his death and Callum is brought to the headquarter in Madrid, Spain. Callum meets the CEO Alan Rikkin and learns that he is a descendant of members from the Assassin's Creed, a brotherhood that protects the Apple from the Templars. The Apple is a device that contains the genetic code for free will and the Templars may dominate the humans if they find where The Apple is hidden. Callum is submitted to the Animus, a machine developed by Rikkin's daughter Sofia to relive genetic memories and find where the Apple is. Along the experiment with the Animus, Callum meets his mother and other Assassin's Creed and embraces their cause. But Rikkin, who is a Templar, has retrieved the Apple. What will Callum do?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil As a young boy Callum Lynch witnessed his father murder his mother. Now, 30 years later, he is being executed for murder. However, the execution is faked and, instead of dying, he is transported to a special facility.

This will enable him to fight the arch-enemy of his forefather, the Templars.—grantss Convict Cal Lynch is about to be executed for killing a pimp. Following, he regains consciousness to learn that he is technically dead but is under the ""care"" of Dr. Sofia Rikkin, who, working for a foundation whose scientific work is led by her father, Dr. Alan Rikkin, has devised a new technology for one to be able to inhabit ancestors through links in their DNA. The foundation has amassed a collection of people like Cal who have violence embedded in their DNA, Cal who watched his father murder his mother when Cal was a child. Cal apparently is the only connection back to Aguilar de Nerha, a member in a brotherhood of assassins in late fifteenth century Spain. The foundation's interest in Cal is that connection to Aguilar. They want Cal to inhabit Aguilar's body in a goal of ending violence in the world. As Cal proceeds to do so in a risk to his own life yet again, he has to decide what to do when the foundation has for him an associated goal of retrieving from the fifteenth century the Apple of Eden, then its last known time and locale, which has the key to controlling free will, that power which could be used for good or bad.—Huggo",5.6,"$125,000,000 (estimated)","Michael Fassbender,Marion Cotillard,Jeremy Irons,Brendan Gleeson,Charlotte Rampling,Michael Kenneth Williams,Denis Ménochet,Ariane Labed,Khalid Abdalla,Essie Davis,Matias Varela,Callum Turner,Carlos Bardem,Javier Gutiérrez,Hovik Keuchkerian,Crystal Clarke,Michelle H.

Troy Maxson makes his living as a sanitation worker in 1950s Pittsburgh.

Bitter over his missed opportunity, Troy creates further tension in his family when he squashes his son's chance to meet a college football recruiter.—Jwelch5742 Like most families, everyone has personal demons or secrets that they try to either suppress or conceal in hopes of retaining a sense of normalcy.

Troy was a baseball star in the late-1930s, playing in the Negro League, and still bears a grudge for his not being able to play Major League Baseball. He projects this, and other experiences, onto everyone around him, particularly Cory, who has the potential to be a football star. More than just influencing Cory's career prospects (adversely, it appears), Troy has a larger-than-life impact on the lives of everyone around him.—grantss Troy Maxson works as a sanitation worker in mid-1950s Pittsburgh. Despite his humble occupation, he is a man with great pride who once harboured dreams of becoming a professional baseball player.

As a result, even though Troy remains dedicated to his wife and family, his experiences and emotional baggage impact his relationship with his son, Cory. After all, Troy refuses to support his son's dream of pursuing a football career.

The '20s are roaring. Liquor is flowing, bullets are flying, and one man sets out to make his mark on the world. Prohibition has given rise to an endless network of underground distilleries, speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops. Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston police captain, has long since turned his back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now having graduated from a childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay of the city's most fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills, and notoriety of being an outlaw. But life on the dark side carries a heavy price. In a time when ruthless men of ambition, armed with cash, illegal booze, and guns, battle for control, no one-neither family nor friend, enemy nor lover-can be trusted. Beyond money and power, even the threat of prison, one fate seems most likely for men like Joe: an early death. But until that day, he and his friends are determined to live life to the hilt. Joe embarks on a dizzying journey up the ladder of organized crime that takes him from the flash of Jazz Age Boston to the sensual shimmer of Tampa's Latin Quarter to the sizzling streets of Cuba.

299,3. Call Me by Your Name,2017,"It's the summer of 1983, and 17-year-old Elio is spending the days with his family at their villa in Lombardy, Italy. He soon meets Oliver, who's working as an intern for Elio's father. They discover the heady beauty of awakening desire. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, the new film by Luca Guadagnino, is a sensual and transcendent tale of first love, based on the acclaimed novel by André Aciman. It's the summer of 1983 in the north of Italy, and Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a precocious 17-year-old young man, spends his days in his family's 17th-century villa transcribing and playing classical music, reading, and flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel). Elio enjoys a close relationship with his father (Michael Stuhlbarg), an eminent professor specializing in Greco-Roman culture, and his mother Annella (Amira Casar), a translator, who favor him with the fruits of high culture in a setting that overflows with natural delights. While Elio's sophistication and intellectual gifts suggest he is already a fully-fledged adult, there is much that yet remains innocent and unformed about him, particularly about matters of the heart. One day, Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old American college graduate student working on his doctorate, arrives as the annual summer intern tasked with helping Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of the setting, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.—Sony Pictures Classics Northern Italy, 1983. Elio, a 17-year-old, spends the summer at his family's country house--a villa surrounded by captivating Mediterranean landscapes that radiate a serene vibe. Apart from his parents, there is also Oliver, a 24-year-old American doctoral student working as an intern. Soon, Elio and Oliver develop a timid friendship and an unexpected bond forms. And against the backdrop of incurable summer ennui, the unexplored emotions of first love boil over after six ephemeral weeks. Could this sun-kissed romance in Lombardy be the prelude to maturity?—Nick Riganas The Perlmans own a villa outside of Moscazzano in Northern Italy, where they spend their summers and Hannukah. They invite a graduate student to spend six weeks with them over the summer to help Professor Perlman with his work. This summer - 1983 - the student in question is an American named Oliver. While there, Oliver largely associates with the Perlmans' seventeen-year-old son Elio and Elio's friends, the females among the group whose hearts are aflutter by Oliver's preppy good looks. Oliver, in fact, takes up casually with one of them, Chiara. Elio is an intellectual, but has no experience with girls as he is only now experimenting with his initial stage of manhood and masculinity. If not for Oliver, Elio probably would have chosen Chiara himself, and as such takes up with Marzia instead. Despite their social association and sleeping in adjoining rooms in the villa, Elio doesn't much like Oliver, thinking him too cocky and arrogant partly in that brash American sensibility. In turn, Oliver believes Elio is patronizing in his outward dislike of him. These outward behaviors mask the fact that there is a deep attraction between Elio and Oliver based largely on their admiration of the other's intellect. When they eventually admit that attraction late into Oliver's stay, Oliver is more reticent to act on those feelings in not wanting to ruin his own or Elio's life in still being in the closet, while Elio wants to experience all that sex and love are as he is in the flush of first real love. With Oliver and Elio's clandestine relationship, Elio has to figure out what to do about Marzia, he who may be aware or unaware of her own very deep feelings for him in also experiencing that flush of first love. The other question then becomes if Elio will be able to recover as there will definitely be an end at least to this phase of Oliver and Elio's romance when Oliver leaves to go home at the end of the summer.—Huggo It's the summer of 1983, and precocious 17-year-old Elio Perlman is spending the days with his family at their 17th-century villa in Lombardy, Italy. He soon meets Oliver, a handsome doctoral student working as an intern for Elio's father.

Young farmer Johnny Saxby numbs his daily frustrations with binge drinking and casual sex, until the arrival of a Romanian migrant worker for lambing season ignites an intense relationship that sets Johnny on a new path. Spring. Yorkshire. Isolated young sheep farmer Johnny Saxby numbs his daily frustrations with binge drinking and casual sex, until the arrival of a Romanian migrant worker Gheorghe, employed for the lambing season, ignites an intense relationship that sets Johnny on a new path. Johnny Saxby has turned into a sullen young man in needing to take on the proverbial and literal heavy lifting at the family's sheep and cattle farm in Northern England following his father Martin Saxby's stroke, which has rendered him physically disabled, and he requiring a cane to walk still with difficulty. Johnny has taken on this role without much passion and thus without placing much effort into it, especially as Martin is still looking over his shoulder at every turn. Johnny relieves his boredom by drinking to excess at the pub - he getting to the point of needing to vomit every time - and, gay, having casual, indiscriminate and passionless sex with whichever bloke he meets. During the busy birthing season, Martin hires Gheorghe Ionescu, a Romanian migrant farm worker, for a one week period. There is an immediate animosity between Johnny and Gheorghe largely over dealing with the stereotype Johnny has of all Romanians being shifty Romanis aka gypsies. In reality, Gheorghe, who grew up on such a farm back home, knows his farming well and places much care in it unlike Johnny. While Johnny and Gheorghe are away on a several day trip to work on a remote part of the farm, their animosity leads to some physicality between them which further leads to some sexual tension and ultimately a sexual relationship. In their solitude, their relationship turns more intimate, something that has never happened before for Johnny. Gheorghe, who is more experienced in true matters of the heart than Johnny, knows the current status of their relationship is unsustainable, something that Johnny may never get a point to in never having been there. Their relationship however does give Johnny a better understanding of how to live in his path on the farm with his parents especially in the circumstance of Martin's poor and deteriorating health.—Huggo Since his father Martin's disabling stroke, adolescent Johnny Saxby needs to grow up fast and step up to save the Yorkshire family's sheep and cattle farm, but it's not his choice and grumpy ingrate parental meddling doesn't help to motivate, so he drowns his sorrows in too much ale frequently, often vomiting afterwards, limiting his further social life to meaningless gay one-offs. For the back-breaking lambing season, Martin hires for a week Gheorghe Ionescu, an actually experienced Romanian migrant farm worker, with more professional dedication. Despite ignorantly calling the 'intruder' a gypsy, Johnny learns from him, and after jumping each-other's bones in the mud on the meadows, they start his first-ever more intimate relationship, yet it has no future, but provides some mentoring Johhny can use on all fronts.—KGF Vissers",7.6,N/A,"Josh O'Connor,Gemma Jones,Harry Lister Smith,Ian Hart,Alec Secareanu,Melanie Kilburn,Liam Thomas,Patsy Ferran,Moey Hassan,Naveed Choudhry,Sarah White,John McCrea,Alexander Suvandjiev,Stefan Dermendjiev",Not,Francis Lee,"Picturehouse Entertainment,Orion Pictures,Samuel Goldwyn Films,Another World Entertainment,Atlantic Film,Pacific Northwest Pictures,Pyramide Distribution,Rialto Distribution,Look Now!,NonStop Entertainment,Salzgeber & Company Medien,September Film Distribution,Filmcenter Trianon,Atlantic Film,Film1,Front Row Filmed Entertainment,Lionsgate,Fine Films,Yleisradio (YLE)","British Film Institute (BFI),Creative England,MetFilm Production,Shudder Films,Inflammable Films","Drama,Romance",104

316,20. Novitiate,2017,"Set in the early 1960s and during the era of Vatican II, a young woman in training to become a nun struggles with issues of faith, the changing church and sexuality. 1964. Cathleen Harris, in her late teens, has resided at the Convent of the Beloved Rose in her home state in the American south for close to two years, first as a postulant for six months, before taking her first vows to become a novice. Unlike the other postulants and novices, Sister Cathleen was raised in a household without religion, let alone Catholicism. As such, her decision to become a nun, which went against her divorced mother's wishes, may be more secure in her mind than her colleagues for which this life course may be more bred within them. The convent is led by the Mother Abbess, Reverend Mother Marie Saint Clare, whose entire life is this convent off of where she not stepped foot in forty years. Reverend Mother believes she is the voice of God within the walls of the convent, and thus does not tolerate any of the sisters questioning her authority. She also believes that the Catholicism which she has known all her life is perfect. When she receives an edict regarding the Second Vatican Council - more commonly referred to as Vatican II - which, opened in 1962 as a process to make the Catholic church more open to modern ideals, she refuses to implement any of the changes, let alone discuss the edict with any of the sisters, especially with the likes of Sister Mary Grace, the Mistress of Postulants and Novices who has more contemporary views of the church. Sister Cathleen's drive to become a nun is set against this backdrop, her process which is not as easy as it appears to the others, and whether she makes it to nun is affected by the Reverend Mother's strict methods and refusal to modernize.—Huggo In 1954, seven-year-old Cathleen Harris lives in rural in Tennessee with her mother, Nora, a factory worker, who is non-religious but wants to show Cathleen a church and let her make her own decision. Cathleen's father, Chuck, comes home late, drunk, and argues with his wife. Chuck eventually leaves. Nora supports herself and picks up a series of men for one-night stands. At age 12, Cathleen seeks love of her own, and finds it in Catholicism when two nuns visit her home and offer her enrollment at a Catholic girls' school. The school offers her free tuition and a full scholarship to any college Cathleen chooses if her grades are excellent. At the school one day, a young nun befriends Cathleen and describes how she is married to Christ. At age 17 in the year 1964, after Cathleen comes home from school and runs into another one of her mother's pickups, Cathleen decides to leave home and give her life to God.. Raised by a vehemently non-religious, single mother (Nicholson) in rural Tennessee during the '50s, a scholarship to Catholic school soon finds Cathleen (Qualley) drawn into all the mystery and romanticism of a life devoted to the worship and servitude of God. With the dawn of the Vatican II era, radical changes in the Church are threatening the course of nuns' lives. Cathleen finds herself struggling with issues of faith, sexuality, and the changing administration.",6.7,,"Melissa Leo,Lisa Stewart,Alyssa Brindley,Chelsea Lopez,Liana Liberato,Eline Powell,Margaret Qualley,Morgan Saylor,Rebecca Dayan,Hannah Renèe Jackson,Marco St. John,Julianne Nicholson,Eliza Stella Mason,Bill Shick,Danny Vinson,Chris Zylka,Angela Fox,Neva Howell,Sasha Mason,Peggy Walton-Walker,Ashley Bell,Rosemary Brown,Gabe Beutel-Gunn,Dianna Agron,Maddie Hasson,Marshall Chapman,Denis O'Hare,Payton Christian,Emily Conley,Darla Pelton-Perez,Lance Sutton,Walter Swierk,Brian Abston,Robert Happy Allen,Kirk H.

Shortly after landing, she dies from complications while giving birth to the first human born on the red planet - never revealing who the father is. Thus begins the extraordinary life of Gardner Elliot - an inquisitive, highly intelligent boy who reaches the age of 16 having only met 14 people in his very unconventional upbringing. While searching for clues about his father, and the home planet he's never known, Gardner begins an online friendship with a street smart girl in Colorado named Tulsa.

Is it humankind's greatest achievement? 12 billion miles away a tiny spaceship is leaving our Solar System and entering the void of deep space. It is the first human-made object ever to do so. Slowly dying within its heart is a plutonium generator that will beat for perhaps another decade before the lights on Voyager finally go out. But this little craft will travel on for millions of years, carrying a Golden Record bearing recordings and images of life on Earth. In all likelihood Voyager will outlive humanity and all our creations. It could be the only thing to mark our existence. Perhaps some day an alien will find it and wonder. The story of Voyager is an epic of human achievement, personal drama and almost miraculous success. Launched 16 days apart in Autumn 1977, the twin Voyager space probes have defied all the odds, survived countless near misses and almost 40 years later continue to beam revolutionary information across unimaginable distances. With less computing power than a modern hearing aid, they have unlocked the stunning secrets of our Solar System on a journey as revolutionary as the first circumnavigation of the globe and humankind's first footprint on the moon. In this powerful, poetic and cinematic feature documentary, THE FARTHEST celebrates these magnificent machines, the men and women who built them and the vision that propelled them farther than anyone could ever have hoped. Launched from a fractious planet, these pioneers sail on serenely in the darkness - an enduring testament to the ingenuity of humankind and the untapped limits of the human imagination.

The crown jewel of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service, Agent Lorraine Broughton (Theron) is equal parts spycraft, sensuality and savagery, willing to deploy any of her skills to stay alive on her impossible mission. Sent alone into Berlin to deliver a priceless dossier out of the destabilized city, she partners with embedded station chief David Percival (James McAvoy) to navigate her way through the deadliest game of spies.—Focus Features Just before the fall of Berlin's wall in 1989, the lethal MI6 secret agent, Lorraine Broughton, is sent to Cold-War Germany to meet her contact, the station chief, David Percival, after the murder of a fellow undercover agent. Intent on recovering an invaluable microfilm containing the list of names of every British spy, Lorraine must do battle with endless waves of hard-as-nails KGB agents and unrelenting henchmen, in the bowels of a city at boiling point. Under those circumstances, as both sides want the list desperately, whom can Lorraine trust?—Nick Riganas In November 1989, just days prior to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, MI6 agent James Gascoigne is shot and killed by KGB agent Yuri Bakhtin, who steals The List, a microfilm document concealed in Gascoigne's wristwatch that contains the names of every intelligence agent (on both sides) active in Berlin. Ten days later, Lorraine Broughton, a top-level MI6 spy, is brought in to be debriefed by MI6 executive Eric Gray and CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld about her just-finished mission to Berlin. The plot jumps between the debrief room and flashbacks to Lorraine's time in Berlin.. London, November 1989. Beautiful and lethal, MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton is being interrogated by her superior Eric Gray, and against her objections CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld, it a debrief concerning a just concluded mission in Berlin ""gone wrong"" in certain respects in what ended up being the approach to the fall of the wall. Murdered MI6 agent James Gascoine was supposed to have a comprehensive list of secret agents on both sides given to him by a Stasi agent named Spyglass, that list getting in the wrong hands i.e. the KGB which would tip the balance of the Cold War. In Gascoine's death, the list had gone missing, Broughton dispatched to Berlin undercover to recover the list from who they believe currently has it, a KGB agent named Yuri Bakhtin, she to work with MI6's Berlin section chief David Percival, who has immersed himself in the bohemian Berlin lifestyle both as a cover but also as a personal choice. Broughton felt that there was someone tipping off the KGB as she believed her cover was blown as soon as she arrived in Berlin, which leads to the reason for her objection of Kurzfeld being in the meeting in she not wanting to divulge information that he should perhaps not know: that she had a secondary mission in Berlin, namely to discover the identity of a mole who had long been giving MI6 problems, that agent going by the code name Satchel. She didn't know if Satchel was the source of the leak of her identity to the KGB and/or the young, mysterious woman she noticed following her ever since her arrival in town. With regard to the list, she learned that Spyglass himself could be as important an asset to the West as the list, he wanting to defect however with conditions.—Huggo",6.7,"$30,000,000 (estimated)","Charlize Theron,James McAvoy,Eddie Marsan,John Goodman,Toby Jones,James Faulkner,Roland Møller,Sofia Boutella,Bill Skarsgård,Sam Hargrave,Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson,Til Schweiger,Barbara Sukowa,Attila Árpa,Martin Angerbauer,Lili Gesler,Sara Natasa Szonda,Declan Hannigan,Balázs Lengyel,Daniel Hargrave,Greg Rementer,Daniel Bernhardt,Cale Schultz,Attila Hasznosi,Kurt Loder,Ronald Reagan,Balázs Veres",TV-14,David Leitch,"Focus Features,Batrax Entertainment,Sierra / Affinity,ACME,ACME,ACME,Andes Films,Blitz Film & Video Distribution,Blitz Serbija,Blitz,Cathay-Keris Films,Central Partnership,Chantier Films,Cinemaxx,DeAPlaneta,Forum Film Slovakia,Future Film,Golden Scene,HKC Entertainment,Italia Film,Italia Film,Italia Film,Italia Films,Kadokawa,Lenta,Long Shong Entertainment Multimedia Company,Lotte Entertainment,M Pictures,Main Title Pictures,Meloman,Mis.

As war brews over in 1939 Warsaw, and while life is still running its course, the Germans are gradually making their presence felt, with Adolf Hitler secretly preparing for the invasion of Poland. Under those volatile circumstances, the couple of Jan Zabinski and Antonina Zabinska continue with their daily routine as owners of the Warsaw Zoo; however, their life's work, and the city, will turn to ashes when the Luftwaffe's horrific Stukas begin to hammer the capital. Now, with the zoo liquidated for the war effort, and many of its animals tragically perished, what was once a menagerie, will now serve as a sanctuary, where the pair of veterinarians can hide the persecuted Polish-Jewish people in plain sight. Indeed, that was the dangerous plan of the two altruists, who, regardless of the consequences, refused to wither before the Nazi menace, and sheltered three hundred Jewish men, women, and children right under the noses of the enemy. Will the world remember the zookeeper's wife?—Nick Riganas Dr. Jan Zabinski (Johan Heldenbergh) is the director of the Warsaw Zoo, one of the largest and most prolific zoos in 1930s Europe. He is aided by his wife, Antonina (Jessica Chastain). On September 1, 1939, the aerial bombardment of Warsaw commences as German forces storm Poland. Bombs raze the zoo cages, killing many animals while others escape into the streets. Antonina and her son Ryszard (Timothy Radford and later, Val Maloku) barely survive. As Polish resistance collapses, Dr. Lutz Heck (Daniel Bruhl), the head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist and Jan's professional rival, arrives at the zoo when Jan is away. He offers to house the prized animals and return them to Warsaw after the war. Heck later returns with Nazi soldiers to shoot the remaining animals. It becomes evident that Heck has developed a romantic interest in Antonina.",7.0,"$20,000,000 (estimated)","Jessica Chastain,Johan Heldenbergh,Daniel Brühl,Timothy Radford,Efrat Dor,Iddo Goldberg,Shira Haas,Michael McElhatton,Val Maloku,Martha Issová,Daniel Ratimorský,Frederick Preston,Theo Preston,Viktoria Zakharyanova,Goran Kostic,Arnost Goldflam,Marian Mitas,Martin Hofmann,Jitka Smutná,Waldemar Kobus,Viktorie Jenicková,Adira B.

Table 19,2017,"Eloise, having been relieved of maid of honor duties after being unceremoniously dumped by the best man via text, decides to attend the wedding anyway, only to find herself seated with five fellow unwanted guests at the dreaded Table 19. Ex-maid of honor Eloise (Anna Kendrick) - having been relieved of her duties after being unceremoniously dumped by the best man via text - decides to hold her head up high and attend her oldest friend's wedding anyway. She finds herself seated at the 'random' table in the back of the ballroom with a disparate group of strangers, most of whom should have known to just send regrets (but not before sending something nice off the registry). As everyone's secrets are revealed, Eloise learns a thing or two from the denizens of Table 19. Friendships - and even a little romance - can happen under the most unlikely circumstances.—Fox Searchlight Pictures It is with mixed emotions that Eloise McGarry accepts the invitation to attend the wedding of Francie Millner and Douglas Grotsky, the festivities to take place at an upscale resort on an island on a lake, the island accessible only by ferry. The issue is that Francie is her oldest friend and she was to be Francie's maid of honor up until two months ago when Francie's brother, Teddy Millner, her boyfriend at the time and Doug's best man, unceremoniously dumped her via text message after dating for two years. Teddy's current girlfriend, Nikki, who he dated before Eloise, also replaced Eloise as maid of honor after Eloise already organized most of the wedding. Eloise doesn't want her and Teddy's issues to overshadow Francie and Doug's big day, they, who indirectly through Nikki, don't want her to either in moving her to Table 19 of nineteen at the reception, which Eloise knows is the table not only of the misfits, but those who were not smart enough to realize they really weren't wanted to attend the wedding. The others at Table 19 are: Jo Flanagan, Francie and Teddy's first nanny when they were kids; always bickering married couple Bina and Jerry Kepp, diner owners, acquaintances of Doug's father who owns a chain of diners, the Kepps who weren't even seated with other such acquaintances; high schooler Renzo Eckberg, whose mother encouraged him to attend instead of going to his high school prom as a better prospect to lose his virginity as no one at the reception knows him; and Mr. Millner's socially awkward nephew Walter Thimble, his uncle who never expected him to show up ""under the circumstances"". Once Eloise is able to convince those that were incredulous as to their status at the reception of being at Table 19, they all slowly begin to open up about their misfit status, which leads to some issues which none of those seated at that table thought they would be discussing with anyone at the wedding let alone total strangers they just met. Foremost, they want to help Eloise find true happiness especially in light of her situation, that happiness which may include finding a mysterious white knight in shining armor at the reception that Eloise only knows as Huck, possibly to replace Teddy in her heart and life.—Huggo Eloise McGarry attends the wedding of her oldest friend Francie Millner. It's discovered that she was originally maid of honor but ""dropped out"" two months ago after her ex boyfriend Teddy, the bride's brother and the best man, broke up with her by text after two years together. Teddy is now back with his old girlfriend Nikki, who has replaced Eloise as maid of honor. At the reception, Eloise discovers she has been seated at Table 19. While she considers leaving early, she meets a man named Huck who notices her looking distressed and offers words of advice which are not well received. Eloise decides to stay and meets her table mates: Jerry and Bina Kepp, Facebook friends with the groom's father who own a chain of diners; high-school-er Renzo Eckberg, whose parents are acquaintances of the groom and who came to the wedding in the hopes of meeting a girl; Jo Flanagan, Francie's childhood nanny; and Walter Thimble, the bride's cousin who is currently on parole..",5.8,"$5,000,000 (estimated)","Anna Kendrick,Rya Meyers,Charles Green,Lisa Kudrow,Craig Robinson,Tony Revolori,Margo Martindale,Stephen Merchant,Carlos Aviles,June Squibb,Brad Oberhofer,Megan Lawless,Amanda Crew,Jay Klaitz,Wyatt Russell,Richard Haylor,Thomas Cocquerel,Andy Daly,Maria Thayer,Andy Blitz,Becky Ann Baker,Max Silvestri,Nick Arapoglou,Andy Stahl,Sheri Mann Stewart,Matthew Cornwell,Chris Whitley,Elizabeth Faith Ludlow,Omer Mughal,Chelle Ramos,Gabriella Cila,Lontrell Anderson,Nargis Aniston,Amanda Burke Buczek,Tabitha Chappelle,Ian Constantine,Kelsey Cortez,Payson Durant,Shannon Edwards,Fred Galle,Matthew A.

372,2. Gifted,2017,"Frank, a single man raising his child prodigy niece Mary, is drawn into a custody battle with his mother. Frank Adler (Chris Evans) is a single man raising a child prodigy - his spirited young niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) in a coastal town in Florida. Frank's plans for a normal school life for Mary are foiled when the seven-year-old's mathematical abilities come to the attention of Frank's formidable mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) whose plans for her granddaughter threaten to separate Frank and Mary. Octavia Spencer plays Roberta, Frank and Mary's landlady and best friend. Jenny Slate is Mary's teacher, Bonnie, a young woman whose concern for her student develops into a connection with her uncle as well.—Fox Searchlight Pictures In a small town near Tampa, Florida, seven-year-old Mary Adler lives with uncle and DE FACTO guardian, Frank. Her best friend is her 40-ish neighbor, Roberta. On her first day of first grade, she shows remarkable mathematical talent, which impresses her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson. There, despite her initial disdain for average children her own age and her boredom with their classwork, she begins to bond with them when she brings her one-eyed cat, Fred, for show-and-tell and later defends a classmate from a bully on the bus. Mary is offered a scholarship to a private school for gifted children. However, Frank turns it down. Based on his family's experiences with similar schools, he fears Mary will not have a chance at a normal childhood. Single Frank Adler, who works as a freelance boat repairman and lives in a trailer park on the Florida coast, has been guardian to his seven year old niece Mary Adler since she was a newborn after her mother, Frank's sister, Diane Adler, committed suicide. At the time, Frank was a Philosophy professor at Boston University, he moving with Mary in an effort to ""escape"". Like her mother, Mary is a math prodigy, of which Frank is well aware. Frank has home schooled Mary up until now in an effort to protect her from people like who he was escaping from, his and Diane's own mother, uncompromising (to use Frank's vernacular) Evelyn Adler, who, if she had custody, would have had a singular focus in the math prodigy aspect of Mary, much like she was with Diane. Frank, who has largely treated Mary like an equal in being up front with her about most things, has now decided to send Mary to a regular public school in an effort to socialize her to other children and to make her feel like a normal child, with their neighbor, adult Roberta Taylor, Mary's only real friend besides Frank. Roberta routinely sits with Mary to allow Frank his regular Friday out at the bar for himself. Although Frank cautions Mary about not being too ""obvious"" at school, Mary's teacher, Bonnie Stevenson, quickly discovers not only Mary's advanced math abilities, but her background being Diane's daughter. Although Miss Stevenson, like Frank, wants what's best holistically for Mary, the process to provide an advanced education to Mary at the expense of all else begins to snowball to the point where Evelyn learns of Frank and Mary's whereabouts. Not agreeing with any of Frank's choices, Evelyn sues for full custody, which brings into light the entire dynamic that existed and exists between Evelyn, Frank and Diane.—Huggo While living his carefree life as a boat repairman, Frank Adler is raising his seven year old niece Mary by himself in western Florida as her de facto guardian.

373,3. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,2017,"Robbed of his birthright, Arthur comes up the hard way in the back alleys of the city. But once he pulls the sword from the stone, he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy - whether he likes it or not. An alternative version of the King Arthur legend. As a boy, Arthur is left orphaned after his father, King Uther Pendragon, and mother are killed in a war waged against them by Vortigern, who then assumes the throne. Arthur flees and is raised in a brothel, knowing very little of his birthright. Vortigern wants Arthur dead, to ensure there is no claimant to the throne. The legends foretell that only the next king will be able to draw Excalibur, Uther's sword, from the rock where it is lodged. So, in an effort to identify Arthur, Vortigern forces all the young men of Arthur's age to attempt to draw out the sword. Now it is Arthur's turn.—grantss Mordred, an iron-fist-ed warlock, and his armies lay siege to Camelot, seeking to establish the dominance of magic-wielding mag-es over humankind. Uther Pendragon, king of the Britons, infiltrates Mordred's lair and beheads him, saving Camelot. Uther's treacherous younger brother Vortigern, who covets the throne, orchestrates a coup and sacrifices his wife Elsa to moat hags to become a demon knight, who kills Uther's wife Igraine and slays Uther in combat. The only survivor is Uther's son Arthur, who drifts away in a boat and ends up in Londinium.. Struggling to eke out an existence in Londinium's squalid and perilous streets, the orphaned young fighter and Uther Pendragon's only son, Arthur, is utterly oblivious to the fact that he is England's rightful ruler. Nearly two decades after his traitorous uncle, Vortigern, usurped the throne, Arthur is now the only one who can pull out from the magical boulder the legendary and long-lost blade of Excalibur; however, Vortigern is hell-bent on identifying him, and then, stopping him.

394,24. Churchill,2017,"Ninety-six hours before the World War II invasion of Normandy, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill struggles with his severe reservations with Operation Overlord and his increasingly marginalized role in the war effort. June 1944. Allied Forces stand on the brink: a massive army is secretly assembled on the south coast of Britain, poised to re-take Nazi-occupied Europe. One man stands in their way: Winston Churchill. Behind the iconic figure and rousing speeches: a man who has faced political ridicule, military failure and a speech impediment. An impulsive, sometimes bullying personality - fearful, obsessive and hurting. Fearful of repeating, on his disastrous command, the mass slaughter of 1915, when hundreds of thousands of young men were cut down on the beaches of Gallipoli. Obsessed with fulfilling historical greatness: his destiny. Exhausted by years of war and plagued by depression, Churchill is a shadow of the hero who has resisted Hitler's Blitzkrieg. Should the D-Day landings fail, he is terrified he'll be remembered as an architect of carnage. Political opponents sharpen their knives. General Eisenhower and Field Marshal Montgomery are increasingly frustrated by Churchill's attempts to stop the invasion. King George VI must intervene. Only the support of Churchill's brilliant, yet exasperated wife Clementine can halt the Prime Minister's physical and mental collapse. The untold story of Britain's most celebrated leader, uncovering the true nature of Churchill's herculean war-time status and his vital relationship with ""Clemmie"" - his backbone and total confidant...the love that inspired him to greatness.

401,6. The Florida Project,2017,"A single mother and the manager of a roadside motel do their utmost to maintain the innocence of a six-year-old girl's life. Halley lives with her six year old daughter Moonee in a budget motel along one of the commercial strips catering to the Walt Disney World tourist clientele outside Orlando, Florida. Halley, who survives largely on welfare, has little respect for people, especially those who cross her, it an attitude that she has passed down to Moonee, who curses and gives the finger like her mother. Although the motel's policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonee's friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobby's existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.—Huggo The Magic Castle, a garishly painted motel in the shadow of Walt Disney World's famous Magic Kingdom, is what Halley, a struggling single mother, and Moonee, her mischievous 6-year-old daughter, call home. But in sparky Moonee's eyes, this unappealing world, crammed with imperceptible lost souls, is a blissful utopia. However, the illusion of a carefree life always comes at a high price. And as hard-pressed Halley takes increasingly dangerous risks to eke out an existence, the consequences of her decisions become a matter of survival. At the end of the day, Halley is at a crossroads: whether she likes it or not, the young mother must either trust those around her or face danger alone. After all, we all face the consequences of our actions. And as harsh reality enters the picture, Halley will face the music.

For 10 idyllic years, young Mija (An Seo Hyun) has been caretaker and constant companion to Okja-a massive animal and an even bigger friend-at her home in the mountains of South Korea. But that changes when a family-owned multinational conglomerate Mirando Corporation takes Okja for themselves and transports her to New York, where image obsessed and self-promoting CEO Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) has big plans for Mija's dearest friend. With no particular plan but single-minded in intent, Mija sets out on a rescue mission, but her already daunting journey quickly becomes more complicated when she crosses paths with disparate groups of capitalists, demonstrators and consumers, each battling to control the fate of Okja...while all Mija wants to do is bring her friend home.

419,24. The Rider,2017,"After suffering a near-fatal head injury, a young cowboy undertakes a search for new identity and what it means to be a man in the heartland of America. Brady Blackburn, a rodeo bronc rider with some renown, learned everything he knows about horses and riding from his parents, Wayne and the now deceased Mari Blackburn. Brady is recovering from a fall off a bronking horse in a rodeo, the most serious of the injuries being a skull fracture which required a metal plate being inserted into his head. Including checking himself out of the hospital earlier than advised, Brady is determined to get back up onto the literal and proverbial horse as quickly as possible as being a cowboy is all he knows. But deep in his heart he knows that returning to the rodeo in particular is something that is probably not in the cards without increased risks, which is eventually confirmed by his doctor who tells him that he cannot sustain another serious head injury without some major consequence. He does not even want his friends and family to treat him with kid gloves in being able to do any of those physical activities which are part and parcel for him of being a man and a cowboy. Brady has to come to some realization as to this fact and come to terms with it - which is difficult even as his best friend, former rodeo rider Lane Scott will forever be institutionalized needing around the clock medical care from a similar accident - or end up killing himself physically in the attempt to bronc again, or killing himself emotionally in not being able to do what he loves.—Huggo Brady lives in poverty with his father Wayne and his younger sister Lilly, who has autism.

Brady regularly visits his friend Lane, who lives in a care facility after suffering severe brain damage from a similar bull-riding accident. Meanwhile, his dad does little to take care of the family, wasting their money away on drinking and gambling. To help keep their trailer, he sells away their horse, Gus, much to Brady's infuriating. Brady, in return, gets a job as a store clerk to help try to raise money for the family.. Once a rising star of the rodeo circuit, and a gifted horse trainer, young cowboy Brady (Brady Jandreau) is warned that his riding days are over after a horse crushed his skull at a rodeo.

Having left Earth, Optimus Prime finds his dead home planet, Cybertron, and discovers that he was in fact responsible for its destruction. Optimus learns that he can bring Cybertron back to life, but in order to do so, he will need an artifact that is hidden on Earth. Humans and Transformers are at war, Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving our future lies buried in the secrets of the past, in the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Saving our world falls upon the shoulders of an unlikely alliance: Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg), Bumblebee, an English Lord (Sir Anthony Hopkins) and an Oxford Professor (Laura Haddock).—ahmetkozan Three years after Optimus Prime left Earth, the Autobots are still a world threat, at war with the Decepticons.

They meet English Lord, Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins) and head to a Cybertronian Knights' ship, deep underwater. Here they encounter Optimus Prime, now evil, and his master, Quintessa. Quintessa's intention is to collide Cybertron and Earth so Cybertron can begin again - so it's up to Cade; English professor Vivian Wembley (Laura Haddock); Sir Edmund Burton; Cogman; Bumblebee; and the rest of the Autobots to save the world.—ahmetkozan In 484 A.D., King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) and his knights fight a losing battle against the Saxons.

431,11. Loving Vincent,2017,"In a story depicted in oil painted animation, a young man comes to the last hometown of painter Vincent van Gogh to deliver the troubled artist's final letter and ends up investigating his final days there. A year after the death of artist Vincent van Gogh (Robert Gulaczyk), Postman Joseph Roulin Chris O'Dowd) gets his slacker son, Armand (Douglas Booth), to hand deliver the artist's final letter written to his now late brother, Theo (Cezary Lukaszewicz), to some worthy recipient after multiple failed postal delivery attempts. Although disdainful of this seemingly pointless chore, Armand travels to Auvers-sur-Oise where a purported close companion to Vincent, Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn), lives. Having to wait until the doctor returns from business, Armand meets many of the people of that village who not only knew Vincent, but were apparently also models and inspirations for his art. In doing so, Armand becomes increasingly fascinated in the psyche and fate of van Gogh as numerous suspicious details fail to add up. However, as Armand digs further, he comes to realize that Vincent's troubled life is as much a matter of interpretation as his paintings, and there are no easy answers for a man whose work and tragedy would only be truly appreciated in the future.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In the summer of 1891 in France, nearly twelve months after master painter Vincent van Gogh's (Robert Gulaczyk's) mysterious death, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth), the local postman's (Chris O'Dowd's) young son, is reluctantly tasked with delivering one of the artist's final letters to his brother, Theo (Cezary Lukaszewicz), in Paris. However, when Armand discovers that Theo, too, met his own demise, he embarks on a mission to investigate Vincent's untimely death, starting off from scenic Auvers-sur-Oise. Has Van Gogh committed suicide or was he murdered? As Armand's search for evidence continues, there's more to this enigma than meets the eye.—Nick Riganas One year after Vincent van Gogh's (Robert Gulaczyk's) suicide, Postman Joseph Roulin (Chris O'Dowd) asks his son Armand (Douglas Booth) to deliver van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo (Cezary Lukaszewicz). Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely a few weeks earlier, van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris. Pere Tanguy (John Sessions), a Montmartre art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to Auvers-Sir-Oise and look for Dr. Paul Gachet (Jerome Flynn), who housed van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at the same inn that van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress Adeline Ravoux (Eleanor Tomlinson), who was fond of van Gogh and who was also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite (Saoirse Ronan). When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.",7.8,"EUR5,000,000 (estimated)","Douglas Booth,Josh Burdett,Holly Earl,Robin Hodges,Chris O'Dowd,John Sessions,Helen McCrory,Eleanor Tomlinson,Aidan Turner,Saoirse Ronan,Joe Stuckey,James Greene,Martin Herdman,Bill Thomas,Jerome Flynn,Robert Gulaczyk,Piotr Pamula,Cezary Lukaszewicz,Bozena Berlinska-Bryzek,Anastazja Seweryn,Borys Dominiuk,Bartlomiej Sroka,Kamila Djouabri,Przemyslaw Furdak,Adam Pabudzinski,Keith Heppenstall,Graham Pavey,Nina Supranionek,Marcin Sosinski,Richard Banks,Carole Le Clanche,Shaun Newnham,Andrew Scott-Marshall",PG-13,"DK Welchman,Hugh Welchman","Altitude Film Entertainment,Beijing Herui FIlm Culture,Cinemanse,Cinemex Films S.A. de C.V.,Cinéart,Elite Filmes,La Belle Company,Mongrel Media,Next Film,Parco Co.

438,18. My Cousin Rachel,2017,"A young Englishman plots revenge against his late cousin's mysterious, beautiful wife, believing her responsible for his death. But his feelings become complicated as he finds himself falling under the beguiling spell of her charms. Philip, an orphan, was taken in and brought up by his cousin Ambrose, a Devon landowner he loves like a father. At a time, Ambrose, who has been advised by his physician a warmer climate, leaves for Tuscany. There he meets and marry Rachel, a half-Italian cousin of his. After an idyllic outset, the situation deteriorates. Shortly before his death, Ambrose manages to alert Philip: his wife is killing him slowly. Willing to sort out the truth, Philip goes to Ambrose's place but he does not find Rachel, who has gone away. Instead he meets Rainaldi, her friend and lawyer, who does not inspire him with confidence. He returns to his estate, persuaded that Rachel is evil and is the direct cause of Ambrose's death. Some time later, Rachel announces her coming. Determined to welcome her coolly, he is stunned to discover a woman not only beautiful but elegant, intelligent and sensitive. Instead of strangling her like he said he would, he falls in love. Madly.—Guy Bellinger Ushered into an entirely male domain by the compassionate relative, Cousin Ambrose, the orphaned Philip Ashley is taken in and brought up as a true son on his guardian's estate in the rugged and wind-swept Cornwall. However, the father and son bond will shatter when the adoptive cousin who has found love and the woman of his dreams in sun-drenched Florence, dies unexpectedly, leaving Philip, who is now nearing 25, devoured by grief and a sickening suspicion of foul play. As a result, the young heir prepares to confront his protector's widow, nevertheless, utterly unprepared for the sophisticated and elegantly enigmatic woman who sweeps into his life and the family's manor. Now powerless, much to his surprise, Philip is entranced by her beguiling charm, ready to offer her the world, but is it love, wealth or freedom the beauteous Cousin Rachel yearns for?—Nick Riganas After the young boy Philip is orphaned, he is adopted by his older cousin Ambrose, who raises him as a son on his large estate in Cornwall. Despite societal beliefs of the necessity of motherhood, Philip grows up with a nearly complete absence of women in the household, before Ambrose leaves the estate for the sunnier climate of Florence. A young man, Philip is left with his godfather Nick Kendall, and learns through correspondence that Ambrose has met his widowed cousin Rachel in Florence, and they have wed. The Kendalls express surprise that Ambrose has become interested in women, though Philip found the absence of female companionship natural. Later, Ambrose begins sending letters indicating distrust of the medical care he is receiving in Florence. Concerned, Philip travels to Italy, only to be informed Ambrose has died and Rachel has left. Though Ambrose's will left the entire estate to Philip pending his next birthday, Philip is convinced Rachel is guilty of murder and threatens her friend Rinaldi with revenge..

Reluctantly, he settles into retirement, accepting that Preston, a smooth-talking, more politically savvy cop has taken his place-a cop he mentored.

446,1. Dunkirk,2017,"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Commonwealth and Empire, and France are surrounded by the German Army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II. May/June 1940. Four hundred thousand British and French soldiers are holed up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats in addition to its hard-pressed Navy to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two Royal Air Force fighter pilots, and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet.—grantss World War II. The enemy forces have cornered four hundred thousand British and French soldiers on the French coast at Dunkirk. A small number of primarily-French soldiers are guarding the perimeter, where the British and French soldiers are amassed, which is getting increasingly smaller as enemy forces advance. Most of those British and French soldiers are now on the beach waiting for destroyers to come and take them back to Britain. Each of the countries are taking care of their own. The British are leaving first and among those the wounded get first priority despite their taking up seven times the space of the able-bodied soldiers. An issue with Dunkirk is that there is only one dock the destroyers can access, which needs to be protected from the enemy bombs. As such, Churchill, newly elected, has put out a call for civilian watercraft to head to Dunkirk both to transport supplies and to transport soldiers from the beach to the destroyers or back to Britain if at all possible. Within this situation, four general stories are told. In one, Commander Bolton, the top British Naval officer on the ground, knows deep in his heart that the soldiers are largely sitting ducks on the beach as the enemy planes fly over. He knows that the situation is a catch-22 for the British in that they need to bring as many soldiers safely home as possible at the depletion of their military resources, which in turn they need to preserve for the day if, but more likely when, the enemies make their way onto British soil. In the second story, a squadron of three Royal Air Force Spitfires are amongst those limited air resources that are embarking in dog fights with enemy planes, while protecting the soldiers on the ground. In the process, they have to ensure their own safety in order to provide what is needed for the ground soldiers, which includes knowing about things like fuel levels and having enough to make their way back to home base whenever required. In the third story, two soldiers meet on the beach, the two of them knowing that the longer they remain on the beach, the likelier they are not to survive this skirmish. As such, they try to do whatever they need to to make it onto one of those destroyers or any other watercraft making its way back to Britain. However, making it aboard a ship does not necessarily ensure their survival, and in the final story, Mr. Dawson, his young-adult son Peter, and their seventeen-year-old friend George are on Dawson's pleasure craft making its way to Dunkirk to do their part in the war effort, all realizing the dangers involved. They have to decide at each step along the way if they will focus on personal problems or if they will continue on to assist in the war, as was their first priority when they left Britain.—Huggo In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable Naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, three hundred thirty thousand French, British, Belgian, and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.—Jwelch5742 In late May 1940, the Second World War had been raging for eight months when German troops, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Belgium and then swept into France. As a result, the outnumbered Allied Forces collapsed under the weight of the invasion, and 400,000 troops found themselves stranded on the sandy shores of Dunkirk, a French coastal town on the cold North Sea. The German Luftwaffe relentlessly bombed the beach, cornering the Allied troops. However, with England only 33.3 kilometres away across the Strait of Dover, a massive evacuation, codenamed Operation Dynamo, was imperative. The procedure involved hundreds of naval and civilian vessels to evacuate the stranded soldiers. While three Royal Air Force Spitfires tried to fend off the Nazi attacks, a civilian captain, along with his son and his friend, worked tirelessly to rescue as many soldiers as possible. Despite the odds, the evacuation was successful--a pivotal point in the war effort. The operation made history as the ""Miracle of Dunkirk"".—Nick Riganas",7.8,"$100,000,000 (estimated)","Fionn Whitehead,Damien Bonnard,Aneurin Barnard,Lee Armstrong,James Bloor,Barry Keoghan,Mark Rylance,Tom Glynn-Carney,Tom Hardy,Jack Lowden,Luke Thompson,Michel Biel,Constantin Balsan,Billy Howle,Mikey Collins,Callum Blake,Dean Ridge,Bobby Lockwood,Will Attenborough,Kenneth Branagh,Tom Nolan,James D'Arcy,Matthew Marsh,Cillian Murphy,Adam Long,Harry Styles,Miranda Nolan,Bradley Hall,Jack Cutmore-Scott,Brett Lorenzini,Michael Fox,Brian Vernel,Elliott Tittensor,Kevin Guthrie,Harry Richardson,Jochum ten Haaf,Johnny Gibbon,Richard Sanderson,Kim Hartman,Calam Lynch,Charley Palmer Rothwell,Tom Gill,John Nolan,Bill Milner,Jack Riddiford,Harry Collett,Eric Richard,Glyn Angell,Sam Aronow,Simon Ates,Caleb Bailey,Sander Blom,Wilhelm Bonnelle,Michael Caine,Hugo-Vincent Couturier,Sam Dacombe,R.A.

Caesar and his apes are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel. After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.—ahmetkozan After being constantly attacked by the humans, despite asking for peace, Caesar and the Apes decide to find a new home safe from the humans. But after the tragic deaths of the most recent attack from the humans, Caeser embarks on a mission to kill the ruthless human Colonel.—Ronald Pickleson Two years after the misanthropic bonobo Koba attacked the human survivors in San Francisco, Caesar and his tribe of intelligent apes have been forced against a rogue U.S. military faction known as Alpha-Omega led by a ruthless colonel. Alpha-Omega employs other apes formerly loyal to Koba, derogatorily called ""donkeys"". An Alpha-Omega platoon launches an attack on an ape outpost, but it fails and four soldiers, including one named Preacher and a ""donkey"" gorilla named Red, are captured. Caesar releases the soldiers, hoping the display of mercy will show the Colonel that the apes are not savages; Red escapes by injuring the albino gorilla Winter. Later, Caesar's eldest son Blue Eyes and lieutenant Rocket return from a long journey. Blue Eyes reports that they found a place across the desert that is ideal for the apes. Despite an uneasy Winter asserting that the apes should leave immediately, Caesar decides they need to prepare first. That night, the Colonel leads a team of soldiers in infiltrating the apes' home, killing Blue Eyes and Caesar's wife Cornelia; Caesar unsuccessfully attempts to prevent the Colonel's escape. Afterward, the apes are unable to find Winter, who they believe betrayed them out of fear. A few years after Koba's uprising, Caesar and his ape tribe are put to the ultimate test when they find that the conflict with humans is escalated by a powerful new enemy who seeks to destroy Caesar and his family. While Caesar, Maurice, Rocket and their tribe have suffered so much loss and pain, Caesar finds that he must fight the evil within himself as he must make one final stand to save his people in a war that will determine both the future of his people and the world.—Blazer346",7.4,"$150,000,000 (estimated)","Andy Serkis,Woody Harrelson,Steve Zahn,Karin Konoval,Amiah Miller,Terry Notary,Ty Olsson,Michael Adamthwaite,Toby Kebbell,Gabriel Chavarria,Judy Greer,Sara Canning,Devyn Dalton,Aleks Paunovic,Alessandro Juliani,Max Lloyd-Jones,Timothy Webber,Lauro David Chartrand-Del Valle,Shaun Omaid,Roger Cross,Mercedes de la Zerda,Douglas Chapman,James Pizzinato,Chad Rook,Dean Redman,Steve Baran,Sandy Robson,Levi Meaden,Billy Wickman,Albert Nicholas,Kyle Horton,Paul Luongo,Thomas Potter,Mathew Yanagiya,Skye Notary,Willow Notary,Finn Notary,Phoenix Notary,Sadie Aperlo,Matilda Aperlo,Andrew Alexander Reeves,Emmanuel Amadeo Badal,Michael Germant,Kent R.

451,6. Detroit,2017,"Fact-based drama set during the 1967 Detroit riots in which a group of rogue police officers respond to a complaint with retribution rather than justice on their minds. A police raid in Detroit in 1967 results in one of the largest race riots in United States history. The story is centered around the Algiers Motel incident, which occurred in Detroit, Michigan on July 25, 1967, during the 12th Street Riot. It involves the death of three black men and the brutal beatings of nine other people: seven black men and two white women.—chris The true story of one of the most terrifying moments during the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of '67. Amidst the chaos of the Detroit Rebellion, with the city under curfew and as the Michigan National Guard patrolled the streets, three young African American men were murdered at the Algiers Motel. 50 years after the events of July 25th, 1967, the question remains: what happened at the motel?—Annapurna Pictures The race riots that occurred in the predominantly black Victoria Park neighborhood of Detroit in late July, 1967 are presented. The riots began on July 23 following a raid on an unlicensed after hours black club serving liquor in celebration for just returned black soldiers from the war. The confrontation between the black populace of the neighborhood and police escalated with increasing action on both sides, those actions including burning and looting in the neighborhood on the public side, and the setting of curfews and calling in the National Guard to assist by Michigan Governor George Romney. The movie focuses on a situation on the evening of July 25 in the Algiers Motel, where the authorities, led by the Detroit Police Department, were searching for a supposed sniper firing at the authorities, the motel which should have been a place of sanctuary away from riots happening outside the motel walls. The individuals at the motel that evening include the following. White DPD Officer Phillip Krauss has his own moral stance where he will do whatever required to exact his form of justice, which included the day before mortally shooting a black looter in the back as he was running away unarmed. That incident the day before colors the way Krauss now handles such confrontations. A singular white National Guardman on the scene knows the volatility of the situation based on the patrolmen's actions, but does whatever he can to keep those being interrogated alive while not stepping on the toes of the police. Melvin Dismukes is a black part-time security guard who does whatever he can to diffuse the situation all in an effort for the black populace to survive whatever given situation at the time. Larry 'Cleveland' Reed, the lead singer for the Dramatics, and his friend Fred Temple took refuge at the motel after a gig which could have been the Dramatics big break was canceled at the last minute due to the riots, which left them outside after curfew. Carl Cooper, a resident at the motel, wanted white people to feel the fear black people felt every day at the hands and more specifically guns of the police. Greene, a black man, is a recently decommissioned soldier, who is solely in Detroit trying to find a job. And Julie Ann and Karen are two young white women from Ohio staying at the motel, they who have no issue in partying with the predominantly black residents and other guests at the motel.—Huggo On July 23, 1967, the Detroit Police Department staged a raid on an unlicensed club during a celebration for returning black veterans from the Vietnam War. While suspects are being arrested, a mob forms and starts throwing rocks at the officers before looting nearby stores and starting fires, beginning the 12th Street Riot. With state authorities, elected representatives, and even emergency services unable to maintain any semblance of order, Governor George W. Romney authorizes the Michigan Army National Guard and President Lyndon B. Johnson authorizes Army paratroopers to enter Detroit in order to provide assistance. On the second day of rioting, two cops pursue a fleeing looter. One of them, Philip Krauss, kills the man with a shotgun against orders, but is allowed to remain on duty until his superiors can decide whether to file murder charges.",7.3,"$34,000,000 (estimated)","Chris Chalk,Mason Alban,Bennett Deady,Andrea Eversley,Michael Jibrin,Khris Davis,Joshua Olumide,Daniel Washington,Amari Cheatom,Tyler James Williams,Laz Alonso,Benz Veal,Angel Blaise,Lance Law,Jaleel Sanders,Raymond Moreno,Donald StJohn,Kegan Cline,Corinne Pitts-Wiley,Will Poulter,Ben O'Toole,Jack Reynor,Jacob Latimore,Ashley L.

452,7. Girls Trip,2017,"When four lifelong friends travel to New Orleans for the annual Essence Festival, sisterhoods are rekindled, wild sides are rediscovered, and there's enough dancing, drinking, brawling and romancing to make the Big Easy blush. Four best friends, the ""Flossy Posse"", have grown distant over the years. When lifestyle guru Ryan Pierce (Regina Hall), who is dubbed ""the next Oprah"", is offered an opportunity to be the keynote speaker at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, she decides to bring along her friends to turn her work vacation into a girls' trip. Joining Ryan is Sasha (Queen Latifah), an ex-journalist from Time Magazine who now owns a floundering gossip site and is struggling financially; Lisa (Jada Pinkett Smith), a nurse and uptight mom who has not had a boyfriend since her divorce years earlier and Dina (Tiffany Haddish), a happy-go-lucky, impulsive party animal who was fired after assaulting a co-worker shortly before the trip. While on the trip, Sasha is sent a tip that shows a picture of a black man's head kissing an Instagram model, presumed to be Ryan's husband, Stewart. The friends are reluctant to tell Ryan, but when Dina spills the news, Ryan shocks them by telling them she is already aware of the situation and that they are in couple's counseling. Nevertheless, when Dina sees Stewart at their hotel, she threatens him with a broken bottle, resulting in her getting ejected and banned from the hotel. In solidarity all the girls leave with her, but the only hotel they are able to get is a sleazy one-star motel frequented by customers of prostitutes. Writer and lifestyle guru Ryan Pierce, often touted as a mixture of the next Oprah Winfrey/Martha Stewart, and her Florida A and M college sweetheart husband, former football star Stewart Pierce, have developed themselves into a successful brand in providing inspiration to the world. Their manager, Elizabeth Davelli, has not only managed to get Ryan the keynote speaker position at this year's Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, but also a meeting for both in New Orleans with Bethany Marshall of major retailer Best Mart to discuss a potential lucrative partnership including a lifestyle television show, which would put them on the top echelon of their business. What Ryan has not told anyone is there is problems in the marriage, Stewart who has cheated on her, something she is unaware still continues. That problem only masks Ryan's insecurity, her fear being exposed as a fraud to her fans. Ryan decides to invite her three best friends from college, they who were known as the Flossy Posse, to New Orleans for the VIP/five star weekend. Graduating approximately twenty years ago, they, at the time, believed they would be BFFs, but time and changes in their lives have led to them not hanging out together as a group in five years. Sasha Franklin, once a respected journalist, has for various reasons become a celebrity gossip blogger and is now broke, close to losing everything which she has not told the others in the posse. The party girl in college, divorced Lisa Cooper has become the conservative nurturer, her entire focus now on her two children and her career as a nurse rather than herself, sex which has been non-existent since the divorce. And Dina was and still is the type that will do whatever she wants and state her mind without fear of whatever the possible consequences, which has just led to her being fired from her latest job. This mixture of circumstances in their lives, especially desperate Sasha possibly going to extreme lengths for dirt on anyone famous this weekend for money, may end up testing their friendship, that test exacerbated if things for Ryan and Sasha spiral downward out of control.—Huggo",6.2,"$19,000,000 (estimated)","Regina Hall,Queen Latifah,Jada Pinkett Smith,Tiffany Haddish,Larenz Tate,Mike Colter,Kate Walsh,Kofi Siriboe,Lara Grice,Deborah Ayorinde,Janeline Hayes,Wild Wayne,Sunny Hostin,Nick Mundy,Ricky Wayne,Shrey Vyapari,Donna Biscoe,Aadyn Encalarde,Cayden K.

469,2. What Happened to Monday,2017,"In a world where families are limited to one child due to overpopulation, a set of identical septuplets must avoid being put to a long sleep by the government and dangerous infighting while investigating the disappearance of one of their own. In a not so distant future, where overpopulation and famine have forced governments to undertake a drastic One-Child Policy, seven identical sisters (all of them portrayed by Noomi Rapace) live a hide-and-seek existence pursued by the Child Allocation Bureau. The Bureau, directed by the fierce Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close), enforces a strict family-planning agenda that the sisters outwit by taking turns assuming the identity of one person: Karen Settman. Taught by their grandfather (Willem Dafoe) who raised and named them - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday - each can go outside once a week as their common identity, but are only free to be themselves in the prison of their own apartment. That is until, one day, Monday does not come home. The year is 2073, where overpopulation, limited fossil fuels and global food shortage have led to the biggest crisis in human history and the enforcement of the strict mandatory one-child-per-family policy, called the ""Child Allocation Act"". Under those circumstances, the ruthless political activist Nicolette Cayman promises a bright future in a brave new world, while at the same time, Terrence Settman decides to get around the government's decree, in a desperate attempt to hide his septuplet grandchildren. As a result, the siblings named after each day of the week will inevitably take turns as Karen Settman, named after their late mother, going out in the world only on the corresponding days of the week, sharing information with the rest of the sisterhood every night. And then, one day, something happens to Monday.—Nick Riganas In a far and not so bright future when population boom leads to a shortage of food, water, and dwelling the government legislate on a one-child policy. At this tough time, identical septuplets (7 children born at the same time) are born and kept hidden by their grandfather. Lost their mother giving birth, and named after the days of the week, they're now trained to act like one person to keep their secret from the guards who are everywhere and check everyone at each corner of the streets. What happens to Monday brings on a lot of trouble to her siblings. In the year 2073 where the world's biggest problem is overpopulation due to genetically modified food, increasing the birthrate of twins, triplets, etc. Due to the world's population rapidly increasing day by day, the government decides to create a strict one-child policy. All siblings will be put to sleep using technology called cryosleep, hoping the siblings will wake up to a better world, a utopia. A group of identical septuplets ( played by Noomi Rapace ) go into to hiding, each sibling is named after a day of the week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Each take turns assuming the single identity of Karen Settman, putting on an act as an only child, only to express their true selves at home. Only one child can go outside, according to the day they were named after.

470,3. The Shape of Water,2017,"At a top secret research facility in the 1960s, a lonely janitor forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity. From master storyteller Guillermo del Toro comes THE SHAPE OF WATER, an otherworldly fable set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962. In the hidden high-security government laboratory where she works, lonely Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is trapped in a life of isolation. Elisa's life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) discover a secret classified experiment. Rounding out the cast are Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Doug Jones.—Fox Searchlight Pictures 1962 Baltimore. Elisa Esposito, found abandoned as a baby with scars on her neck, has been mute all her life, that disability which has largely led to her not having opportunities. Despite being a bright woman, she works a manual labor job as a cleaner at a military research facility where she has long been friends with fellow cleaner, Zelda Fuller, who often translates her sign language to others at the facility. And she has had no romance in her life, her major emotional support, beyond Zelda, being her aging gay artist neighbor, Giles, the two who live in adjoining apartment units above a movie theater. Like Elisa, Giles is lonely, his homosexuality complicating both his personal and professional life, the latter as a commercial graphic artist. Elisa's life changes when Colonel Richard Strickland brings a new ""asset"" into the facility, Elisa discovering it being a seeming mixed human/amphibious creature found in the waters of the Amazon. Secretly visiting with the creature, Elisa is immediately drawn to him, and despite he having a violent side as part of his inherent being, the two find a way to communicate with each other and end up forming a bond with each other. Elisa has to decide what to do when she discovers that although the reason for bringing the creature to the facility is to test the possibility of him being sent into space, Colonel Strickland, who has always had antagonistic feelings toward the creature, ultimately wants to kill him, this following the systematic torture he has inflicted on him. Elisa may have to balance her feelings on wanting to be with the creature against what may be the greater benefit to him of being set free back into the wilds of the water. Complicating matters are that the Soviets are also aware of the creature, they having a secret agent who has infiltrated the facility.—Huggo In early-sixties Baltimore, during the peak of the space race and the Cold War, Elisa Esposito works as a night-time janitor in a top-secret underground research facility. Elisa, a woman with a speech disability leading a lonely life, spends her days with only two friends: Zelda, her co-worker who does all the talking for both of them and Giles, her ageing neighbour. One day, an Amazonian Amphibian Man arrives at the facility and is kept in a confined water tank. The creature soon becomes the centre of attention and a mystical bond forms between the two species. However, the creature's survival depends on an unlikely saviour. Can there be a future when one is trapped?—Nick Riganas Elisa is a mute, isolated woman who works as a cleaning lady in a hidden, high-security government laboratory in 1962 Baltimore. Her life changes forever when she discovers the lab's classified secret -- a mysterious, scaled creature from South America that lives in a water tank. As Elisa develops a unique bond with her new friend, she soon learns that its fate and very survival lies in the hands of a hostile government agent and a marine biologist.—Jwelch5742",7.3,"$19,400,000 (estimated)","Sally Hawkins,Michael Shannon,Richard Jenkins,Octavia Spencer,Michael Stuhlbarg,Doug Jones,David Hewlett,Nick Searcy,Stewart Arnott,Nigel Bennett,Lauren Lee Smith,Martin Roach,Allegra Fulton,John Kapelos,Morgan Kelly,Marvin Kaye,Dru Viergever,Wendy Lyon,Cody Ray Thompson,Diego Fuentes,Madison Ferguson,Jayden Greig,Karen Glave,Danny Waugh,Dan Lett,Deney Forrest,Brandon McKnight,Clyde Whitham,Jonelle Gunderson,Cameron Laurie,Evgeny Akimov,Sergey Nikonov,Vanessa Oude-Reimerink,Alexey Pankratov,Uhraney Adrian,Samuel Bisson,Terry Brandon,Glen Brough,Victoria Charters,Cyndy Day,Guillermo del Toro,Carmen Gillespie,Maxine Grossman,Shane Clinton Jarvis,Samantha Kelly,Matthew MacCallum,Renee McClellan,Jim Pagiamtzis,Johnny Prince,Nathan Robitaille,Amanda Smith,Joe Vercillo",TV-MA,Guillermo del Toro,"Fox Searchlight Pictures,20th Century Fox,Hispano Foxfilms S.A.E.,20th Century Fox Australia,20th Century Fox de Chile,Hotstar,KVH Media Group,20th Century Fox Argentina,20th Century Fox Netherlands,20th Century Fox Sweden,20th Century Fox,20th Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Big Picture 2 Films,CinemArt,Forum Hungary,Imperial / Cinepix,Nordisk Film,Nordisk Film,Odeon,TME Films,Ukrainian Film Distribution (UFD),Warner Bros.

After getting involved, the pastor loses control of every aspect of his life. A lonely and depressed pastor of a small historical church, Ernst, suffers from extreme PTSD and guilt after a parishioner's spouse takes his own life. This suicide is a trigger point for Ernst as it brings back painful and regretful memories of his own son. He soon spirals out of control. Reverend Ernst Toller of the First Reformed Church in Snowbridge, New York is writing down his thoughts in a journal for a year, after which he intends to destroy it. First Reformed, a 250-year-old Dutch Reformed Church, faces dwindling attendance under Toller's leadership, which has taken the church in a new direction and away from its historical focus on Reformed theology. In trying to manage his own life issues, Toller seeks a deeper experience through reading Roman Catholic (Thomas Merton and G.K. Chesterton) and mystical books (The Cloud of Unknowing). This new spiritual direction leads him to seek support from a nearby charismatic megachurch, Abundant Life, which owns the historical landmark, and previous stop on the Underground Railroad. Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is a solitary, middle-aged parish pastor at a small Dutch Reform church in upstate New York on the cusp of celebrating its 250th anniversary. Once a stop on the Underground Railroad, the church is now a tourist attraction catering to a dwindling congregation, eclipsed by its nearby parent church, Abundant Life, with its state-of-the-art facilities and 5,000-strong flock.

474,7. The Hitman's Bodyguard,2017,"Michael Bryce, a protection agent, is tasked with protecting Darius Kincaid, one of the world's most famous assassins. With his reputation in tatters after the painfully unsuccessful delivery of a distinguished Japanese client, the former triple-A protection agent, Michael Bryce, is now reduced to a mere second-class bodyguard for hire, two years after the disgraceful incident. Under those circumstances, Bryce would do anything to prove his worth, and, before long, he accepts an offer from Interpol to escort the international assassin, Darius Kincaid, from Manchester to the Hague. The task seems simple: Bryce needs to transport him from point A to point B; nevertheless, the trip to the Netherlands is long and hazardous, and Kincaid--as the only one with the guts and enough hard evidence to testify against a tyrannical Belarusian dictator--is an obvious target. Undoubtedly, it's a tough job, as the mismatched duo will have to put aside their grudges, and race against the clock in a non-stop concerto for bullets. Can the hitman's bodyguard carry through the most important mission in his career?—Nick Riganas Belarussian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich is standing trial for genocide. The trial is not going well for the prosecution - their witnesses tend to turn up dead. They have one trump card though - hitman Darius Kincaid is willing to testify against Dukhovich. Interpol try to get Kincaid to the trial but after the convoy is ambushed, Interpol agent Amelia Roussel, aware that there is a Dukhovich spy in her own organisation, calls in outside help - professional bodyguard Michael Bryce. One problem - Bryce and Kincaid hate each other.—grantss London elite bodyguard Michael Bryce lost his AAA status by trusting his police (now ex) lover Amelia Roussel, compromising his Japanese charge, reducing him to babysitting second rate clients. Now she works for Interpol, which needs to escort most-wanted hit-man Darius Kincaid from their Manchester HQ to The Hague, as crown witness against arrested former tyrannical White Russian president Vladislav Dukhovich, in exchange for the liberation of his dragon-bitch-wife Sonia. The armed convoy was attacked and Darius barely reached a safe-house due to an Interpol mole. Amelia promises to restore Bryce's status if he helps get Darius, who happened to eliminate the Japanese client, safely to the Interational Court. Dukhovich's hired guns spare to effort to kill them, so they must grudgingly collaborate.—KGF Vissers Brutal former Belarusian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich is on trial at the World Court in The Hague for crimes against humanity, with the investigation against him led by Interpol. From behind bars, Dukhovich has been able to pull strings to neutralize any witness and/or evidence against him, he certain to get off with the exception of only one possible witness against him left who could cause him some problems. That person is incarcerated hitman Darius Kincaid, who agrees to testify only in return for an issue concerning his also incarcerated wife Sonia Kincaid, a perpetually and inherently angry woman. Interpol agent Amelia Roussel is the head of the security detail for the transport of Kincaid from London, where he is in prison, to The Hague. Roussel's convoy is ambushed shortly after leaving the prison by Dukhovich's team, with only Roussel and Kincaid able to escape together. Knowing that there is a mole in Interpol who was able to tip off Dukhovich as to the details of the transport, Roussel, with Kincaid, goes rogue in trusting no one inside. The unknown mole is her direct superior Jean Foucher, who she would have trusted with her life otherwise. The person she turns to instead is her ex-boyfriend Michael Bryant, a bodyguard who was once, as he likes to put it, triple-A rated in the profession, that is until he lost a client, a known arms dealer, that was at the time still under his guard. He blamed and still blames Roussel for the incident in it being the one and only time he divulged the name of a criminal client to anyone, he certain that she used that information against him and said client, despite her denials. What convinces Bryant to help her, beyond being secretly still in love with her, is success leading to the reinstatement of his triple-A rating. He may change his mind when he learns his ""client"" is Kincaid, with who he has had run-ins ""twenty-eight"" times i.e. Kincaid having tried to kill him that many times in their professional encounters, with Kincaid equally not happy to have Bryant as his bodyguard. Bryant and Kincaid not only battle against each other, but against the clock as Kincaid has to make it to the courtroom by a set time or else the trial ends with Dukhovich's probable acquittal, all the while they still needing to worry about what threats Dukhovich has in their wait, including the mole planted in Interpol.—Huggo",6.9,"$40,000,000 (estimated)","Elodie Yung,Ryan Reynolds,Tsuwayuki Saotome,Roy Hill,Richard E.

478,11. Downsizing,2017,"A social satire in which a man realizes he would have a better life if he were to shrink himself to five inches tall, allowing him to live in wealth and splendor. A new world of possibilities awaits, thanks to a revolutionary medical procedure known as Downsizing. Billed as environmentally-friendly, many people choose to downsize for economic benefits. When the kindly occupational therapist, Paul, undergoes the new procedure, finding himself in this brand-new existence, he must choose between a sheltered life or making an impact in his own small way. Can he help save the planet and afford a nice lifestyle at the same time? In the future, searching for a way to solve overpopulation and global warming, a scientist invents ""downsizing"", a process to shrink people to a height of five inches. Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money. Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, New Mexico, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. Scientists have discovered a way to miniaturise life, including humans. This is seen as a solution to overpopulation and people start to voluntarily be 'downsized', forming communities of downsized people. Paul and Audrey Safranek, an average suburban couple, decide to take the plunge.—grantss Much to the surprise of the global scientific community and the rest of the world, the Norwegian scientist, Dr Jørgen Asbjørnsen, has perfected the intricate procedure of cellular reduction known as ""downsizing"": the answer to the rapidly escalating problem of global warming and overpopulation. Ecstatic, the brave couple of Paul and Audrey Safranek decide to trade their ordinary lives for the alluring lifestyle of the rich and famous, to do their part in New Mexico's impeccable minuscule community called Leisure Land Estates. However--even though a chance encounter with the shady entrepreneur and international playboy, Dusan, and the famous Vietnamese political activist, Ngoc Lan, paves the way for new experiences--the intrepid idealists, who are no taller than a few centimetres, realise that their problems remain insurmountable. Now, the future seems bleak.

479,12. 6 Days,2017,"Armed gunmen stormed the Iranian Embassy in London in April 1980, taking hostages. A tense six-day standoff ensued as the SAS, a highly trained military unit, prepared for an unprecedented raid to resolve the crisis. In April 1980, armed gunmen stormed the Iranian Embassy in Princes Gate, London and took all inside hostage. Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.—GFC On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.—Huggo",6.2,,"Jamie Bell,Mark Strong,Abbie Cornish,Martin Shaw,Tim Pigott-Smith,Ben Turner,Emun Elliott,Aymen Hamdouchi,Andrew Grainger,Colin Garlick,Colin Moy,Toby Leach,Martin Hancock,Xavier Horan,Te Kohe Tuhaka,Robert Portal,William Chubb,Ronan Vibert,John Henshaw,Tim Downie,Sam Snedden,Mia Blake,Matthew Sunderland,Emma Campbell-Jones,Jared Turner,Calum Gittins,Ryan O'Kane,Fayssal Bazzi,Kenneth Collard,Nicholas Boulton,Michael Denkha,Scarlett Featherstone,Venice Harris,Marjan Gorgani,Jeff Szusterman,Phil Peleton,Kip Chapman,Ajay Vasisht,Scott Michael Wagstaff,Brady Powell,Jay Sutherland,Joel Beckett,Alan B.

The Glass Castle,2017,"A young girl comes of age in a dysfunctional family of nonconformist nomads with a mother who's an eccentric artist and an alcoholic father who would stir the children's imagination with hope as a distraction to their poverty. A young woman reflects on her unconventional upbringing at the hands of her artsy, nonconformist parents, which sometimes resulted in the family living in poverty. Now engaged to a man who works in finance in New York, she faces criticism from her parents that she's betrayed their values. Contrary wise-guy Rex lost his job as engineer and keeps moving his family around in between poorly paid petty jobs, often fleeing debts, yet promises them a heaven on earth one day, when they built the dream 'glass castle' he keeps refining plans for. Eldest daughter Jeannette is preparing her wedding to doting great catch David, whom she met having paid her way through college and finding a New York job, and pondering how to approach her parents, reminisces in flashbacks how hard growing up and running away was for her, would be-painter mother Rose Mary, brother Brian and sister Lori.—KGF Vissers The life of writer/reporter Jeannette Walls is dramatized, what presented especially in relation to how her growing up shaped that life and thus who she is as a person. That growing up is a non-traditional one. Her mother, Rose Mary Walls, is more concerned with her painting as something that ""will last forever"" than the short term issues of taking care of the family including Jeannette and her three siblings. But the household is dominated by her father, Rex Walls for who family is everything. A brilliant man academically, he can wax poetic about almost any topic, and dreams big which can inspire his children. The biggest dream is to build a ''Utopian"" glass castle in which the family can live for eternity. He is also anti-authority, anti-establishment, controlling, often going to extremes to prove a point, and does not tolerate anyone else's viewpoint against his, especially his children. Exacerbated by his alcoholism, he is unable to hold a job, which results in the family often moving, sometimes going days without food in having no money, often squatting, that latter issue more a choice in his and Rose Mary's empty nest years, and never following through with those big dreams. As Jeanette is able to escape from her parents to eke out a life of her own out of their grip as a young adult, she will have to choose how much access she will have to them, especially as she gets engaged to ""establishment"" financial analyst David, an antithesis to everything Rex in particular espouses.—Huggo",7.1,"$9,000,000 (estimated)","Brie Larson,Woody Harrelson,Naomi Watts,Ella Anderson,Chandler Head,Max Greenfield,Josh Caras,Charlie Shotwell,Iain Armitage,Sarah Snook,Sadie Sink,Olivia Kate Rice,Jack Haven,Shree Crooks,Eden Grace Redfield,Robin Bartlett,Joe Pingue,A.J.

THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI is a dark comedy/crime drama from Academy Award nominee, Martin McDonagh (In Bruges). After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Academy Award winner, Frances McDormand) makes a bold move; she rents three billboards leading into her town, each with a controversial message directed at Bill Willoughby (Academy Award nominee, Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police.

In 1892 after nearly two decades of fighting the Cheyenne, the Apache, and the Comanche natives, the United States Cavalry Captain and war hero Joseph Blocker is ordered to escort the ailing Cheyenne chief, Yellow Hawk--his most despised enemy--to his ancestral home in Montana's Valley of the Bears. Nauseated with a baleful anger, Joseph's unwelcome final assignment is further complicated when widowed settler Rosalie Quaid is taken in by his band of soldiers. Aggressive packs of marauding Comanches are still on the warpath and thirsty for blood, so can the seasoned Captain do his duty one last time?—Nick Riganas In 1892, settler Rosalee Quaid and her family are attacked by a Comanche war group who kill and scalp her husband and also shoot and kill her three children. Only Rosalee manages to escape the attack by hiding in a small rock outcrop in the forest. In Fort Berringer, New Mexico, Captain Joseph Blocker rounds up an escaping Apache family and brings them back to the fort. He is then called to the office of Colonel Abraham Biggs, who informs him of his final orders before retirement. On a directive from President Harrison, he is to escort dying Cheyenne war chief, Yellow Hawk, and four members of his family back to their tribal lands in Montana. Under threat of a court-martial and loss of his pension, Blocker reluctantly accepts, despite his own gory history with the chief, who was responsible for the death of several of his friends and comrades. Blocker chooses the detail that will accompany him: his trusty old friend, First Sergeant Thomas Metz, long-time aide Corporal Woodson, and promising newcomer Lieutenant Kidder, fresh from West Point. Biggs also assigns to the detail a young French-speaking recruit, Private DeJardin. US Cavalry captain Joseph J. Blocker is about to retire in 1892 after a career of protecting Wild West pioneer families by fighting Indian 'savages' from various tribes. Under a presidential order, regimental colonel Abraham Biggs must force him to lead a patrol to return long-imprisoned, terminally-ill Cheyenne chief Yellow Hawk and his four relatives from Fort Berringer, New Mexico, to their Montana native land, the Valley of the Bears, as a 'humanitarian gesture'. Joe's hatred for Indians and cruelty to his charges are kindled as they pass a burnt homestead and take along fresh widow Rosalee Quaid, helping to bury her children. But on the long way, they must pull together to fight off Apache and Comacnhe war parties, where the Cheyenne warrior skills prove invaluable and they manage to bond with Rosalie, while cavalry man fall, including gentle recruit private Philippe DeJardin and one of Joe's old comrades in arms. On the way Rosalie declines settling with commanding lieutenant colonel Ross McCowan's family in a garrison but Joe accepts to deliver to his murder trial a comrade gone rogue, who proves most troublesome.

The two agencies must now work together in order to save the world and take down the so called ""Golden Circle"".—Viir khubchandani A devastating attack leaves the Kingsman with just two surviving agents, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong). They must travel to the United States to find the Statesman, a forgotten ally operating out of Kentucky with its own distinctly American way of doing things. New allies and old friends band together to face the global threat of Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) and the Golden Circle.—Cinemaniacal A year after the events of the previous movie, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) has officially joined the Kingsman, taken his late mentor Harry Hart's (Colin Firth's) title of Galahad, and begun a relationship with Tilde, Crown Princess of Sweden (Henna Alström). On his way home from the tailor shop, he is ambushed by Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft), a former Kingsman trainee who lost his arm and vocal chords (but was inadvertently saved by Eggsy) during the Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) incident. Eggsy evades Charlie and his henchmen in a car chase across London, but Charlie's cybernetic arm, severed in the skirmish, hacks into the Kingsman servers through the computer in Eggsy's car. With the information gained, Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore), the leader of the world's largest drug cartel, the Golden Circle, launches missiles that destroy the Kingsman headquarters and kill all of the agents in Britain, aside from Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong). After a severe attack on the agency, a young male and his boss travel overseas and discover a new evil plot that threatens the world. They team up with their overseas counterparts to do everything that they can to stop the threat and save the world once again.—RECB3",6.7,"$104,000,000 (estimated)","Taron Egerton,Edward Holcroft,Gordon Alexander,Mark Strong,Hanna Alström,Calvin Demba,Thomas Turgoose,Tobi Bakare,Julianne Moore,Keith Allen,Tom Benedict Knight,Colin Firth,Michael Gambon,Sophie Cookson,Björn Granath,Lena Endre,Samantha Coughlan,Channing Tatum,Halle Berry,Elton John,Jeff Bridges,Pedro Pascal,Martyn Ford,Poppy Delevingne,Grant Gillespie,Tara Hugo,Nicholas Colicos,Jordan Mifsud,Kaye Brown,Paul Giddings,Iain McKee,Bruce Greenwood,Emily Watson,Mark Arnold,Shannon Bream,James Carroll Jordan,Bill Hemmer,Stacey Swift,Alessandro De Marco,Antonio Magro,Stephen Schreiber,Count Prince Miller,Jeff Ricketts,Arthur Sylense,Ammara Niwaz,Mingus Johnston,Samantha Womack,James Clayton,Bimbo Hart,Chester King,Alastair Mackintosh,Max Macintosh,Tom Parker-Bowles,Carlos Peres,Alexander Ananasso,Terence Anderson,Anti,AT,Raj Awasti,Jamie-Lee Beacher,David J Biscoe,Paulina Boneva,Annarie Boor,Adrian Bronin,Keith Bunnett,Dan Burns,Alexander Capon,Ross Carter,Jonathan Cass,Renée Castle,Emma Cavell,Will Charlton,Andy Cheung,Daniel Cheung,Callum Chiplin,Ruth Clarson,Gianpiero Cognoli,Alexandra Raphaela Cohen,Crystal Compton,Tony Cook,Richard Cooper,Armin Coralic,Rene Costa,John Crawshaw,Nesba Crenshaw,Grant Crookes,Nick Davison,Leigh Dent,Cristina Dohmen,Robert Eames,Kezie Ejibe,Sam Ettleman,Gary Fannin,Al Fenderico,Alexandra Ford,Rachel Fowler,Lati Gbaja,Claire Greasley,Shane Griffin,Lee Nicholas Harris,Marc Hockley,Mark Holden,Pete Buzzsaw Holland,Honey Holmes,Derek Horsham,Ty Hurley,Petros L.

498,6. Mother!,2017,"A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. Amidst a wild flat meadow encircled by an Edenic lush forest, a couple have cocooned themselves in a secluded mansion that was not so long ago burned to the ground, devotedly restored by the supportive wife. Within this safe environment, the once famous middle-aged poet husband is desirous of creating his magnum opus; however, he seems unable to break out of the persistent creative rut that haunts him. Then, unexpectedly, a knock at the door, the sudden arrival of a cryptic late-night visitor and his intrusive wife will stimulate the writer's stagnant imagination. Little by little, much to the perplexed wife's surprise, the more chaos he lets in their haven, the better for his punctured male ego. In the end, will this incremental mess blemish, irreparably, the couple's inviolable sanctuary?—Nick Riganas In the burnt-out remains of a large house, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study. The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in a landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls. One day, Man turns up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, telling Mother they are fans of his work and Man is dying. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study. A husband and wife, he old enough to be her father, have just moved into the isolated house that she has been renovating and continues to renovate to meticulous standards, it his house which was almost completely destroyed by fire. She does everything for him, including ensuring that his writing room, he a famous poet, is his sanctuary, especially important now as he has writer's block. Never feeling she is doing enough for him, she suffers from anxiety attacks, she self-medicating with an elixir whenever those attacks occur. One evening, they receive a knock on their door by a physician new to the area, he believing it a bed and breakfast. Regardless, the husband welcomes him in like he is an old and his best friend, which the wife cannot understand. It gets worse as the physician's wife then their two adult sons join them, the husband still welcoming them all to the confusion of the wife, especially as they are not the most accommodating of house guests. Concurrently, inexplicable things start to happen around the house about which only the wife notices and keeps to herself. Still loving her husband unconditionally, the wife has to figure out what's going on, especially why the husband seems so concerned about the welfare of others over her.—Huggo",6.6,"$33,000,000 (estimated)","Jennifer Lawrence,Javier Bardem,Ed Harris,Michelle Pfeiffer,Brian Gleeson,Domhnall Gleeson,Jovan Adepo,Amanda Chiu,Patricia Summersett,Eric Davis,Raphael Grosz-Harvey,Emily Hampshire,Abraham Aronofsky,Luis Oliva,Stephanie Ng Wan,Chris Gartin,Stephen McHattie,Ambrosio De Luca,Gregg Bello,Arthur Holden,Henry Kwok,Alex Bisping,Koumba Ball,Robert Higden,Elizabeth Neale,Kristen Wiig,Scott Humphrey,Marcia Jean Kurtz,Anton Koval,Carolyn Fe,Anana Rydvald,Cristina Rosato,Pierre Simpson,Mylene Savoie,Gitz Crazyboy,Shaun O'Hagan,Sabrina Campilii,Stanley B.

500,8. The Death of Stalin,2017,"Moscow, 1953. After being in power for nearly 30 years, Soviet dictator, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, takes ill and quickly dies. Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power. In early-1953 Moscow, under the Great Terror's heavy cloak of state paranoia, the ever-watchful Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, collapses unexpectedly of a brain haemorrhage. As a result, when someone discovers his body the following morning, a frenetic surge of raw panic starts spreading like a virus among the senior members of the Council of Ministers, as they scramble to maintain order, weed out the competition, and ultimately take power. But in the middle of a gut-wrenching rollercoaster of incessant plotting, tireless machinations, and frail allegiances, absolutely no one is safe; not even the feared chief of the secret police, Lavrenti Beria. In the end, who will prevail after the death of Stalin?—Nick Riganas Moscow, 1953. After being in power for nearly 30 years, Soviet dictator Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) takes ill and quickly dies. Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power. At the forefront of the machinations is N.K.V.D. Chief Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria (Simon Russell Beale), after Stalin, the most feared man in the U.S.S.R. Council member Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) does his best to maintain order and thwart Beria's plans.—grantss In the Soviet Union, everyone is used to Jozef Stalin's reign of terror, with daily lists of arrests for torture, banishment, or execution. When Stalin calls a radio producer for the recording of a 1953 concert, he realizes nobody was recording it and hastily arranges for a second turn, keeping even the audience in, despite having to replace the knocked-out director and bribing the soloist, who slips in a note reviling Stalin for having her kin killed. Reading that, Stalin has a fatal cardiac arrest. It takes hours till anyone dares enter his closed office, then ministers argue how to handle his death and struggle to find competent doctors--most having been purged--and are startled: the diagnosis is coma without realistic recovery prospect. Still political alliances are forged for the next Communist reign, including roles for Stalin's arrogant daughter Svetlana and maverick military son Vasily, both overambitious. The former deputy presides over funeral and formal power transfer preparations but especially security chief Beria and Khrushchev plot to become the one purging rather than purged, while inconvenient witnesses are on the next execution lists.—KGF Vissers Farcical imagining of the 1953 goings-on in Moscow in what can be seen as the absurdity of the real life actions of the main players, those actions albeit horrific. Having led the Soviet Union in terror for thirty years with the power of his NKVD security forces to carry out that terror for the last twenty, Joseph Stalin, still relatively healthy and after listening to a live musical broadcast on Radio Moscow for which he wants the non-existent recording immediately, surprisingly drops dead, or so those around him believe as the Party has no expert to tell them so having previously killed all the doctors in Moscow. Those in the inner circle of the Party, while preparing for the State funeral according to Party policy, jockey for position, sometimes openly and sometimes behind the scenes, for their preferred place in the post-Stalin Soviet Union, the worst of those places proverbially six feet under as much of that jockeying is in direct opposition to someone else in that circle. That inner circle is comprised of: Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Moscow Committee; Vyacheslav Molotov, Foreign Secretary; Georgi Malenkov, Deputy to Stalin; Lazar Kaganovich, Minister for Labor; Anastas Mikoyan, Minister for Trade; Nikolai Bulganin, Minister for Defense; and arguably most terrifying Lavrenti Beria, Head of the NKVD. In that jockeying, the players try to curry the favor of: Stalin's two adult children, Svetlana Alliluyeva and Vasili Stalin, who are also not only looking for their future place, which could easily be the way of their father without his protection, but are looking for answers as to what happened; and Field Marshal Georgi Zhukov, Head of the Soviet Army, who has the manpower of the said army behind him.—Huggo",7.3,"$13,000,000 (estimated)","Olga Kurylenko,Tom Brooke,Paddy Considine,Justin Edwards,Adrian McLoughlin,Simon Russell Beale,Jeffrey Tambor,Steve Buscemi,Michael Palin,Paul Ready,Julia Mulligan,Andrii Korzhenivskyi,Roger Ashton-Griffiths,Jeremy Limb,Andy Gathergood,Oleksandr Piskunov,Ruslan Neupokoev,Alla Bineeva,Nicholas Woodeson,Elaine Claxton,George Potts,Sylvestra Le Touzel,Nicholas Sidi,Jonny Phillips,Alex Harvey-Brown,Tim Steed,June Watson,Adam Shaw,Daniel Tuite,David Crow,Dermot Crowley,Paul Whitehouse,Paul Chahidi,Karl Johnson,Cara Horgan,Emilio Iannucci,Daniel Booroff,Andrea Riseborough,Dan Mersh,Rupert Friend,Richard Brake,James Barriscale,Daniel Tatarsky,Ricky Gabbriellini,Eva Sayer,Diana Quick,Adam Ewan,Michael Ballard,Phil Deguara,Jonathan Aris,Katie McCreedy,Ewan Bailey,Jason Isaacs,Leeroy Murray,Keely Smith,Sheng-Chien Tsai,Dave Wong,Sergey Korshkov,Alexander Grigorivev,Olga Dadukevich,Nastya Koshevatskaya,Danila Bochkov,Sebastian Aton,Nastya Karpenko,Amelia McCreedy,Gerald Lepkowski,Luke D'Silva,Daniel Chapple,Daniel Smith,Ellen Evans,Oleg Drach,Daniel Fearn,Rodrig Andrisan,Karen Anstee,Claire Ashton,Derek Barr,Jon Bentley,Silva Beshi,Martin Bratanov,Philip Dedkovskiy,Alex Delescu,Glenn Doherty,Caroline Garnell,Robin George,Vaslov Goom,Jason Grangier,Mg Grazys,Henry Helm,Eloise Henwood,Kornelia Horvath,Ethan Keaton,Attila G.

501,9. Darkest Hour,2017,"In May 1940, the fate of World War II hangs on Winston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate with Adolf Hitler, or fight on knowing that it could mean the end of the British Empire. During World War II, as Adolf Hitler's powerful Wehrmacht rampages across Europe, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Neville Chamberlain, is forced to resign, recommending Winston Churchill as his replacement. But even in his early days as the country's leader, Churchill is under pressure to commence peace negotiations with Hitler or to fight head-on the seemingly invincible Nazi regime, whatever the cost. However difficult and dangerous his decision may be, Churchill has no choice but to shine in the country's darkest hour.—Nick Riganas A thrilling and inspiring true story begins at the precipice of World War II as, within a few days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Sir Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty, and freedom of a nation. As the unstoppable Nazi forces roll across Western Europe and the threat of invasion is imminent, and with an unprepared public, a skeptical King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), and his own party plotting against him, Churchill must withstand his darkest hour, rally a nation, and attempt to change the course of world history.—Jwelch5742 In May 1940, the opposition Labour Party in Parliament demands the resignation of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) for being too weak in the face of the Nazi onslaught. Chamberlain tells Conservative Party advisers that he wants Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane) as his successor, but Halifax does not feel the time is right. Chamberlain is forced to choose the only man who the opposition parties will accept: Sir Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), the First Lord of the Admiralty. Churchill tries to dismiss his new secretary Elizabeth Layton (Lily James) for hearing him, which earns him a rebuke from his wife Clementine (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas). King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), who strongly distrusts Churchill, reluctantly invites him to form a government. Churchill includes Chamberlain (as Lord President of the Council) and Halifax (as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). It's May 1940, the early stages of WWII. The Germans are advancing west on the continent, and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain has lost the confidence of the House in his response. The Conservative party's first choice as a replacement leader is E.F.L. Wood - Viscount Halifax - who believes the timing is not right for him, and as such the party reluctantly chooses Winston Churchill as the new leader who the party members know the opposition supports. To keep his party opponents close, Churchill appoints both Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax to his War Cabinet. Conversely, Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax believe they can either manipulate Churchill into doing what they want or use his failure for Viscount Halifax to make a high profile public move to sweep into power. While Churchill initially holds steadfast to his beliefs, he becomes under increasing pressure, especially at Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax's wants, to enter into peace negotiations with Adolf Hitler led by Hitler's ally, Benito Mussolini, with probably less than favorable terms in being behind the eight-ball. What looks to be the probable result of not negotiating are massive British troop casualties in they being cornered on the French coast as the Germans advance, and the imminent German invasion of Britain. If Churchill decides not to negotiate, is there any way for him to turn things around?—Huggo",7.4,"$30,000,000 (estimated)","Gary Oldman,Kristin Scott Thomas,Ben Mendelsohn,Lily James,Ronald Pickup,Stephen Dillane,Nicholas Jones,Samuel West,David Schofield,Richard Lumsden,Malcolm Storry,Hilton McRae,Benjamin Whitrow,Joe Armstrong,Adrian Rawlins,David Bamber,Paul Leonard,David Strathairn,Eric MacLennan,Philip Martin Brown,Demetri Goritsas,Jordan Waller,Alex Clatworthy,Mary Antony,Bethany Muir,Anna Burnett,Jeremy Child,Brian Pettifer,Michael Gould,Paul Ridley,Robin Pearce,Michael Bott,Olivier Broche,Mario Hacquard,Pip Torrens,Edmund Wiseman,Hannah Steele,Nia Gwynne,Adé Dee Haastrup,James Eeles,Flora Nicholson,Bronte Carmichael,Roisin O'Neill,John Locke,Jo Neary,Richard Glover,Tom Ashley,Joshua Higgott,Imogen King,Miles Gallant,Faye Marsay,John Atterbury,James Harkness,Joshua James,Charley Palmer Rothwell,Patsy Ferran,Sarah Flind,Steffan Donnelly,Kieran Buckeridge,Clive Aitkins,Clare Almond,David Olawale Ayinde,Antony Barlow,Michael Barron,Christopher Ben,David J Biscoe,Annarie Boor,Stephen T Box,Keith Bunnett,John Byrne,Dailis Cirulis,Ruth Clarson,Michael Deighton,Nigel Eaton,David Evestaff,Mike Firth,Robin George,Shane Griffin,Richard Gumm,Cris Haris,Ian Harrod,Michael Haydon,Justin Hayward,Adolf Hitler,Zak Holland,Nick Howden-Steenstra,Tobias James-Samuels,Angelique Joan,Davey Jones,Ethan Keaton,Keith Lomas,Marian Lorencik,Stewart Mathers,Martyn Mayger,Robert McLanachan,Andy Mihalache,Johnny Mindlin,Arnold Montey,Paul A Munday,Hugh O'Brien,Perry J.

507,"15. I, Tonya",2017,"Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband intervenes. From the proverbial wrong side of the tracks in Portland, Oregon, former competitive figure skater Tonya Harding was never fully accepted in the figure skating community for not inherently being the image of grace, breeding, and privilege that the community wanted to portray, despite being naturally gifted in the sport athletically. Despite ultimately garnering some success in figure skating being national champion, a world championship medalist, an Olympian, and the first American woman to complete a Triple Axel in competition, she is arguably best known for her association to ""the incident"": the January 6, 1994 leg-bashing attack on her competitor, Nancy Kerrigan--who, unlike Tonya, was everything that the figure-skating community wanted in their representatives. Her association to that incident led to Tonya being banned from competitive figure skating for life. Tonya's story from the beginning of her figure-skating life at age four to the aftermath of the incident is presented. Besides Tonya herself, key people in her life give their perspective of their role in her life. Although they may agree on the broad issues at hand, such as that the incident did occur, they may vary widely in their recollection of the details. These people are: her waitress mother Lavona Golden, who despite having paid for her expensive figure-skating lessons, was abusive toward her physically and emotionally, never believing she was good enough in any aspect of the word, and who pulled her from school to focus solely on the figure skating; Diane Rawlinson, her first and longest-serving coach, who, for good or bad, largely let Tonya be Tonya in the way she presented herself to the figure skating world; Jeff Gillooly, her first husband, and partner in a turbulent relationship on a need to be loved, perhaps without truly loving each other; Jeff's friend and Tonya's bodyguard Shawn Eckardt, a dim bulb who believed himself to be a bigger player in the big scheme of life than he actually was; and sports journalist Martin Maddox, a fictional character who provides general commentary of what the sports media as a collective wanted out of Tonya and the incident.—Huggo Pushed into skating by her domineering and abusive mother, Lavona Golden, child prodigy Tonya Harding never got a break. Tonya's life has been a roller-coaster ride, from her tumultuous relationship with her first boyfriend, Jeff Gillooly, to her crushing defeat in the 1992 Winter Olympics. Despite being the first American figure skater to perform the notoriously challenging triple axel perfectly in competition, her abundant talent alone wasn't enough. After all, no one will ever forget the infamous incident involving her friend and fellow skater, Nancy Kerrigan. In an attempt to move beyond her troubled past, Tonya's last opportunity to prove herself arose during the 1994 Winter Olympics. Both loved and hated, Tonya Harding's talent and skill have impacted figure skating.—Nick Riganas In 1991, talented figure skater Tonya Harding becomes the first American woman to complete a triple axel during a competition. In 1994, her world comes crashing down when her ex-husband conspires to injure Nancy Kerrigan, a fellow Olympic hopeful, in a poorly-conceived attack that forces the young woman to withdraw from the national championship. Harding's life and legacy instantly become tarnished as she's forever associated with one of the most infamous scandals in sports history.—Jwelch5742 Growing up with an alcoholic, abusive mother, poor, and on the wrong side of the tracks in Portland, Oregon, Tonya Harding would never be accepted when it came to the world of figure skating. Although Tonya was a figure-skating prodigy, beginning her career at age four and winning competitions against competitors twice her age, she lacked the grace, beauty, and lifestyle of what had become known worldwide as the image of a ladies' competitive figure skater. This didn't stop Tonya, however. With the help of Diane Rawlinson, her first and longest coach, Tonya overcame many obstacles and began to make a name for herself in this cut-throat world of skating. Tonya became a national champion, a world medalist, and a member of the US Olympic team twice; she also made history by being the first-ever American woman to land a triple axel in competition. Her alcoholic mother LaVona worked as a waitress to pay for Tonya's coaching, but was horribly abusive and demeaning to Tonya despite her success. Around age 15, Tonya met her future husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, her future ""bodyguard"" Shawn Eckardt. Young, rebellious, and in love, Tonya marries Jeff, who later becomes physically and mentally abusive. Despite Tonya's successes, she is probably most famously known for the 1994 attack on fellow figure-skater and Olympic medalist Nancy Kerrigan. Following the attack, an investigation began and quickly concluded that Jeff Gillooly and Shawn Eckardt were at the center of it. This led to the unveiling of Tonya's involvement in the attack, as many had suspected. Tonya's involvement, regardless of how large or small, resulted in her being banned from the world of competitive figure skating. This movie shows Tonya's life from the beginning of her career in childhood through the end of her career and what followed. Based on actual interviews with Tonya, LaVona, Jeff, Shawn, Diane, and others from that time frame, the viewers get an inside look at her life, issues, relationships and point of view on the attack. I was afraid to watch it since I was a fascinated teen when this took place and figured it would be an exaggerated version of the truth.

510,18. The Disaster Artist,2017,"When aspiring actor Greg Sestero meets the weird and mysterious Tommy Wiseau in an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true. With The Disaster Artist, James Franco transforms the tragicomic true-story of aspiring filmmaker and infamous Hollywood outsider Tommy Wiseau--an artist whose passion was as sincere as his methods were questionable--into a celebration of friendship, artistic expression, and dreams pursued against insurmountable odds. Based on Greg Sestero's best-selling tell-all about the making of Tommy's cult-classic disasterpiece The Room (""The Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made""), The Disaster Artist is a hilarious and welcome reminder that there is more than one way to become a legend--and no limit to what you can achieve when you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.—A24 Films In the 1990s, Greg Sestero is an aspiring actor, who meets the strange Tommy Wiseau in an acting class. Together, Tommy inspires Greg to overcome his nervousness in acting so well that Greg agrees to come to Los Angeles with his odd new friend to pursue their dreams. However, their dreams seem to prove hopeless, especially for Tommy whose mysteriously strange accent and personality repels nearly all around him. Out of an inadvertent suggestion from Greg, Tommy is inspired to instead create his own movie, The Room (2003). What follows is a bizarre struggle to create that film, guided by Tommy, a man who has plenty of money, but not a trace of filmmaking education, experience, talent or even common sense. Along the way, Greg's friendship with Tommy is put to the test as this project takes shape that would produce a film that ultimately becomes a bizarre accomplishment of a cult classic nature that no one, including Tommy, can see coming.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) San Francisco, 1998. Greg Sestero, a young actor waiting for his big break, meets his soulmate, the eccentric amateur performer Tommy Wiseau, in an acting class. With dreams of making it big in Hollywood, the aspiring movie stars move to sunny Los Angeles, only to face one disastrous audition after another. Perhaps the entertainment scene wasn't ready for their talents. And then, in one of those spur-of-the-moment decisions, Tommy and Greg dive into filmmaking to create their first movie. However, despite their burning desire to prove everyone wrong, they quickly understand that they are out of their depth. As they put their hearts into making a mark in the film industry, their combined efforts culminate in The Room (2003)--a monument to courage, perseverance, and passion.—Nick Riganas San Francisco, 1998. Aspiring actor Greg Sestero meets Tommy Wiseau in an acting class. Wiseau is off-the-scale weird and hopelessly untalented as an actor but has a stupendous amount of self-confidence. Sestero and Wiseau form a friendship and move to Los Angeles to pursue their dream of making it big in Hollywood. After landing no roles, they decide to make their own movie. Produced, directed and written by Wiseau and with him in the lead role, the resulting movie is regarded as one of the worst movies ever made, if not THE worst - The Room.—grantss",7.3,"$10,000,000 (estimated)","Dave Franco,James Franco,Seth Rogen,Ari Graynor,Alison Brie,Jacki Weaver,Paul Scheer,Zac Efron,Josh Hutcherson,June Diane Raphael,Megan Mullally,Jason Mantzoukas,Andrew Santino,Nathan Fielder,Joe Mande,Sharon Stone,John Early,Melanie Griffith,Hannibal Buress,Charlyne Yi,Jessie Ennis,Peter Gilroy,Lauren Ash,Karen Macarah,Sugar Lyn Beard,Bob Odenkirk,Brian Huskey,Megan Ferguson,Randall Park,Steven Liu,Tommy Wiseau,Casey Wilson,Jerrod Carmichael,Xosha Roquemore,Kelly Oxford,Kether Donohue,Jeffrey C.

511,19. Suburbicon,2017,"As a 1950s suburban community self-destructs, a home invasion has sinister consequences for one seemingly normal family. In the bosom of Suburbicon--a family-centred, all-white utopia of manicured lawns and friendly locals--a simmering tension is brewing, as the first African-American family moves in the idyllic community, in the hot summer of 1959. However--as the young patriarch, Gardner Lodge, and his family start catching a few disturbing glimpses of the once-welcoming neighbourhood's dark underbelly--seemingly random acts of unprecedented violence paired with a gruesome death will blemish, irreparably, Suburbicon's picture-perfect facade. Who would have thought that darkness resides even in Paradise?—Nick Riganas It is the late-1950s. Suburbicon is your typical, quiet American town. Then an African American family moves into the neighbourhood and the bigoted community goes out of its way to force them to leave. At roughly the same time, two strangers break into the home of their neighbours, Gardner and Rose Lodge, and tie up the family. This leads to a dramatic chain of events.—grantss",5.8,"$25,000,000 (estimated)","Steve Monroe,Gavin Wilde,Landon Gordon,Hope Banks,Karimah Westbrook,James Handy,Mather Zickel,Josh Meyer,Vince Cefalu,Michael D.

Walter, who has not filed a flight plan, suffers a fatal stroke mid-flight, and the plane crashes on a mountaintop in the High Uintas Wilderness.

In the middle of winter, Alex Martin and Ben Bass, a Guardian newspaper photojournalist specializing in stories in conflict zones and a neurosurgeon respectively, meet by chance when they are both booked on the same Boise to Denver flight, canceled due to weather with no other flights leaving until the next morning.

Overhearing Ben's situation, Alex suggests they charter a plane to Denver, they managing to find a willing pilot in Walter, who believes they can beat the storm.

While logically minded Ben believes they are better off staying put with the plane, Alex just cannot sit still in her want to try and make their way to civilization.

517,25. The Wife,2017,"A wife questions her life choices as she travels to Stockholm to see her husband receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. Behind any great man, there's always a greater woman - and you're about to meet her. Joan Castleman (Glenn Close): a highly intelligent and still-striking beauty - the perfect devoted wife. Forty years spent sacrificing her own talent, dreams and ambitions to fan the flames of her charismatic husband Joe (Jonathan Pryce) and his skyrocketing literary career. Ignoring his infidelities and excuses because of his ""art"" with grace and humour. Their fateful pact has built a marriage upon uneven compromises. And Joan's reached her breaking point. On the eve of Joe's Nobel Prize for Literature, the crown jewel in a spectacular body of work, Joan's coup de grace is to confront the biggest sacrifice of her life and secret of his career.—anonymous After nearly forty years of marriage, Joan and Joe Castleman (Glenn Close and Jonathan Pryce) are complements. Where Joe is casual, Joan is elegant. Where Joe is vain, Joan is self-effacing. And where Joe enjoys his very public role as Great American Novelist, Joan pours her considerable intellect, grace, charm, and diplomacy into the private role of Great Man's Wife. Joe is about to be awarded the Nobel Prize for his acclaimed and prolific body of work. Joe's literary star has blazed since he and Joan first met in the late 1950s. THE WIFE interweaves the story of the couple's youthful passion and ambition with a portrait of a marriage, thirty-plus years later--a lifetime's shared compromises, secrets, betrayals, and mutual love.—Sony Pictures Classics This plot description is chronological, although major parts of the film are told in flashback. In 1956, Joan Archer (Annie Starke) meets Joseph Castleman (Harry Lloyd), a handsome young married professor at a women-only college. Although already an accomplished (if unpublished) writer, Joan is awed by Joseph's force of personality and advice that ""a writer must write"". Joan meets a published alumni authoress (Elizabeth McGovern), whose cynical views on opportunities for female writers disheartens Joan. Two years later, Joseph has been fired for having an affair with Joan, his marriage is failing, and his first attempt at writing a novel turns out very poor. Joan, a secretary at a publishing house, observes how the all-male editors dismiss women writers. When Joan criticizes Joseph's work, he threatens to end his relationship with her (claiming she cannot love ""a hack""). Joan agrees to fix Joseph's novel for him. The work, titled The Walnut, is published and becomes a bestseller. By 1960, Joseph and Joan are living in a large seaside home in Connecticut. Joan is hard at work writing a novel, to be published under Joseph's name, while Joseph supports her by cooking, cleaning, and caring for their first child, David. As Joseph and Joan converse, it is apparent that Joan's novel is a reflection of their life together, which bores Joan.. 1992. American novelist Joe Castleman has been named this year's recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, the award not totally a surprise but the ""telephone call"" a relief nonetheless. Joe's wife, Joan Castleman, the two who met in 1958 when she was a student in his Creative Writing class at Smith College, he married to his first wife Carol at the time, is equally as excited, she who is prepared to take on the subordinate role in supporting this Nobel journey with and for him as she has with almost everything else in his life. With their daughter Susannah nearing the end of her pregnancy, the only person that will accompany them to Stockholm is their son, David Castleman, an aspiring writer himself. Although closer to his mother, David is searching for his father's approval instead for his first major writing effort in he being ""the writer"", that approval which seems difficult for Joe to provide regardless of his true views which places a strain between son and father. Much to Joe's chagrin, who also is on the trip to Stockholm is Nathaniel Bone, who is doing research for an unauthorized biography on Joe. The pressure Nathaniel places on Joe and Joan to cooperate with him increases as Nathaniel has received a contract for the biography, the interest greater with Nobel laureate attached to his name. As a greater spotlight is placed on Joe and only by association on Joan in support of him, Joan may come to reevaluate the role she willingly first took on early in their marriage when he was just starting his writing career and that she has played up until now.—Huggo",7.2,N/A,"Glenn Close,Jonathan Pryce,Max Irons,Christian Slater,Harry Lloyd,Annie Starke,Elizabeth McGovern,Johan Widerberg,Karin Franz Körlof,Richard Cordery,Jan Mybrand,Anna Azcárate,Peter Forbes,Fredric Gildea,Jane Garda,Alix Wilton Regan,Nick Fletcher,Mattias Nordkvist,Suzanne Bertish,Grainne Keenan,Isabelle von Meyenburg,Morgane Polanski,Twinnie Lee Moore,John Moraitis,Michael Benz,Johanna Andersson,Catharina Christie,Carolin Stoltz,Håkan Pettersson,Ossian Skarsgård,Pj Barnard,Ben Bradley,Joe Fagan,Leo Horsfield,Lisa Faith McNeilly,Dmytro Morykit,Dougie Rankin,Emma Simpson",R,Björn Runge,"Sony Pictures Classics,BF Distribution,Capelight Pictures,Central Park Films,Cinemundo,Constantin Film,GEM Entertainment,Imagine Films Distribution,Mongkol Major,Pandora Filmes,Picturehouse Cinemas,Picturehouse Cinemas,Provzglyad,SF Studios,SF Studios,Shaw Organisation,Shochiku,Spentzos Films,SquareOne Entertainment,Twentieth Century Fox,Vie Vision Pictures,Capelight Pictures,Capelight Pictures,Central Park Films,Front Row Filmed Entertainment,Lionsgate Home Entertainment,Lionsgate Home Entertainment,Lionsgate,Lionsgate,Remain In Light,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,bf Distribution","Silver Reel,Meta Film,Anonymous Content,Tempo Productions,Embankment Films,Creative Scotland,Spark Film & TV,Film i Väst,Chimney,Sir-Reel Productions,Tempo Productions",Drama,99

Officer ""K"" (Ryan Gosling), unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos.

And as LAPD's Officer K stumbles upon a dangerous secret hidden in plain sight, the taciturn agent must piece the evidence together to locate a ghost, the most vital element in this knotty case. However, is K destined to find the truth and the long-lost Blade Runner (1982)?—Nick Riganas Rick Deckard has vanished. The notorious Blade Runner has been missing since 2019 when he and Rachael escaped from the authorities, and in the process, also avoided the economic and social downfalls of the early 2020s. It's now 2049. Replicants are now closer to humans than ever before, and Blade Runners are still used to ""retire"" the older models that went into hiding from the notorious ""Blackout"" of 2022. In Deckard's place, ""K"" has taken the mantle of Los Angeles' top Blade Runner. However, his world turns upside down when he discovers a box.—Johnny 2049. It's been approximately two decades since the Tyrell Corporation, the creators and original manufacturers of replicants (bioengineered superhumans), went bankrupt, a new generation of replicants manufactured by industrialist Niander Wallace who saved the world with his replicants in establishing synthetic farming in light of collapsing natural ecosystems. While the replicants of the Tyrell era are now outlawed in they having violently rebelled, they ""retired"" (aka destroyed) by blade runners, the Wallace era replicants, which have been programmed to obey, are seen as necessary to society. Many current day blade runners are Wallace era replicants. K, short for his serial number KD6-3.7, is one such blade runner working for the LAPD under Lieutenant Joshi. On one of his assignments, K discovers what he believes are human remains, but on forensic examination are actually the remains of a female replicant who has signs of having given birth during her life, presumably to a human baby. Joshi, fearing the worst of what this finding actually means and it getting into the wrong hands, orders K to discover and destroy any evidence of this finding, which includes locating the baby, probably now grown, and destroying him/her. As K discovers some further evidence to this story concerning his own history (each replicant which is implanted with a manufactured and thus not real history), K begins to suspect that this story may be a little more than just a professional assignment to him and which may jeopardize his future beyond that information getting into the wrong hands with which he will also have to deal.—Huggo",8.0,"$150,000,000 (estimated)","Ryan Gosling,Dave Bautista,Robin Wright,Mark Arnold,Vilma Szécsi,Ana de Armas,Wood Harris,David Dastmalchian,Tómas Lemarquis,Sylvia Hoeks,Edward James Olmos,Jared Leto,Sallie Harmsen,Hiam Abbass,Mackenzie Davis,Krista Kosonen,Elarica Johnson,André Lukács Molnár,István Göz,Pál Nyári,Joshua Tersoo Allagh,Zoltán Béres,Konstantin Pál,Ferenc Györgyi,Samuel Brown,Lennie James,Carla Juri,Kincsö Sánta,Barkhad Abdi,Harrison Ford,Ben Thompson,Suzie Kennedy,David Benson,Stephen Triffitt,Sean Young,Loren Peta,Szabolcs Kelemen,Bernie Leinfelder,Jimmy Star,Kingston Taylor,István Áldott",TV-MA,Denis Villeneuve,"Warner Bros.,Sony Pictures Releasing,Warner Bros.,ACME,ACME,ACME,Alexandra Films,B&H Film Distribution,Big Picture 2 Films,Continental Film,Continental Film,Falcon,Feelgood Entertainment,InterCom,Sony Pictures España,Sony Pictures Filmverleih,Sony Pictures Releasing International (SPRI),Sony Pictures Releasing International,Sony Pictures Releasing Italia,Sony Pictures Releasing Mexico,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Finland,Walt Disney Studios Sony Pictures Releasing (WDSSPR),Warner Bros.,Andes Films,Forum Film,HKC Entertainment,Sony Pictures New Zealand,Sony Pictures Releasing Argentina,Sony Pictures Releasing Australia,Sony Pictures Releasing International,Sony Pictures Releasing International,Sony Pictures Releasing Taiwan,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,United International Pictures,Warner Bros.

519,2. Geostorm,2017,"When the network of satellites designed to control the global climate starts to attack Earth, it's a race against the clock for its creator to uncover the real threat before a worldwide Geostorm wipes out everything and everyone. When catastrophic climate change endangers Earth's very survival, world governments unite and create the Dutch Boy Program: a worldwide net of satellites surrounding the planet, that are armed with geoengineering technologies designed to stave off the natural disasters. After three years of successful protection, something starts to go wrong. Two estranged brothers are tasked with solving the program's malfunction before a worldwide Geostorm can engulf the planet. In an attempt to save the planet from the devastating effects of extreme climate change, an eminent team of scientists led by Jake Lawson manages to build a powerful and elaborate network of satellites known as the ""Dutch Boy"", to practically control the weather. However, when unexplained accidents and catastrophic weather malfunctions start to occur, it's evident that what was invented to protect the Earth has now become its nemesis, wreaking havoc with random attacks. Can Jake and his estranged brother Max stop the string of dysfunctions before a Geostorm--an annihilating worldwide meteorological phenomenon--obliterates mankind?—Nick Riganas In 2019, following many catastrophic natural disasters, an international coalition commissions a system of climate-controlling satellites called ""Dutch Boy"". After Dutch Boy neutralizes a typhoon in Shanghai, a Senate sub-committee reprimands chief architect Jake Lawson for acting without authorization and replaces him with his brother Max, who works under Secretary of State Leonard Dekkom. Three years later, a UN team stationed in the Registan Desert comes across a frozen village. As suspicions rise about the event being caused by a malfunction of Dutch Boy, the US government decides to send one person to find and fix the system. Later, Makmoud Habib, an Indian engineer working on the International Climate Space Station (ICSS), is shown copying data from the Afghanistan satellite onto an external storage device. Habib stores it in his station locker, but he is unexpectedly ejected into space and killed. After convincing President Andrew Palma to conduct an investigation, Max persuades Jake to go to the ICSS to investigate. Another satellite increases temperatures in Hong Kong, causing gas main explosions that nearly kill Max's college friend Cheng Long, the head of Dutch Boy's Hong Kong department.. After several natural disasters on Earth, there is an international coalition of seventeen countries to build a system of satellites to climate control called ""Dutch Boy"" under the command of the chief engineer Jake Lawson. However, the efficient Jake is a free spirit man that despises politicians and is replaced by his estranged brother Max Lawson, who secretly lives with the Secret Service Agent Sarah Wilson. Three years later, UN soldiers find a frozen Afghanistan village. In the International Climate Space Station that is under the administration of the USA but will change in two weeks to an international consortium, the Indian engineer Makmoud Habib copies the data from the satellite responsible for the Afghanistan area to investigate and dies in a mysterious accident. Max convinces Jake to go to the station to investigate what happened. Meanwhile, there is an increase of temperature in Hong Kong, causing fire, explosions and collapse of buildings. Jake teams up with the German chief engineer Ute Fassbinder and her team. Soon Jake and Ute find that a virus was introduced in the system and there is a traitor among them.

With every repetition--or better yet resurrection--Tree gets a little bit closer to the identity of her unknown killer; however, figuring out who he or she may be, always ends up with Tree's death. Wake up; figure out the killer; die; repeat. After all, practice makes perfect.—Nick Riganas After drunken partying the previous evening, university student Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of her classmate Carter Davis. She ignores a phone call from her father David and dismisses Carter while leaving his room and throws away a birthday cupcake given to her by her sorority housemate Lori Spengler. Tree also meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask of the campus mascot - a baby. Tree immediately wakes up in the same way she had previously - in Carter's bed - and is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she nonetheless relives the day and uses this second chance to avoid the tunnel and reach the party. However, the masked killer follows her to the party and murders her again. Tree again wakes up in Carter's bed, realizes that she is in a time loop and barricades herself in her sorority house room to avoid death. The killer, however, is already hiding there and slays her a third time..",6.6,"$4,800,000 (estimated)","Jessica Rothe,Israel Broussard,Ruby Modine,Charles Aitken,Laura Clifton,Jason Bayle,Rob Mello,Rachel Matthews,Ramsey Anderson,Brady Lewis,Phi Vu,Tenea Intriago,Blaine Kern III,Cariella Smith,Jimmy Gonzales,Billy Slaughter,Donna Duplantier,GiGi Erneta,Lindsey G.

Harrison Harry Hole is a detective in the Oslo Police, and a highly successful one too. However, he has been having some personal problems of late, resulting in him turning to alcohol and prescription drugs. The lack of a case to solve isn't helping either. Then a woman disappears and another is murdered. This is looking like the work of a serial killer, one with a particular calling card - a snowman.—grantss At a remote cabin amid-st heavy snowfall, a brutal man named Jonas confronts his lover about their illegitimate son who leaves the house and builds a snowman. The woman threatens to tell Jonas' family about the child, and Jonas leaves angrily in his car. The woman and her son pursue him, but lose him in the snow. She lets go of the steering wheel, causing the car to drive off the road onto a frozen lake. The boy manages to escape from the sinking car, but the woman stays inside in an apparent suicide.. Harry Hole, an inspector with the Oslo PD, is suffering from emotional issues which has led to insomnia and drinking to cope. Although Harry is no longer in a relationship with Rakel Fauke, she wants him to remain in her son Oleg's life - Harry the closest thing Oleg has ever had to a father in Rakel not knowing who his biological father is - despite she being in another serious relationship with plastic surgeon Dr. Mathias Lund-Helgessen, who tries to be that positive adult male role model as Oleg has begun acting out. Harry's emotional issues and his focus on work often results in he not being there for Oleg when Oleg relies on him. At work, Harry has just started teaming with Katrine Bratt, a new recruit from the Bergen PD, as their cases start to mesh. A missing woman case that Katrine is investigating seems to be related to a personal note Harry received marking itself with a figure of a snowman. Although Harry is slow to be convinced, he and Katrine begin to believe that the missing woman is just the latest in serial murders, all the female victims mothers and wives seemingly in unhappy marriages, with the killer's calling card snowmen, meaning that he kills only in winter. The investigation is only complicated by Katrine's unspoken ulterior motive in moving from Bergen to Oslo which takes her on a path to businessman Arve Støp, the high profile lead for Oslo's current World Cup bid, and why the killer seemingly has chosen Harry as his ""confidante"" in that initial note and other subsequent measures.—Huggo",5.2,"$35,000,000 (estimated)","Michael Fassbender,Rebecca Ferguson,Charlotte Gainsbourg,Jonas Karlsson,Michael Yates,Ronan Vibert,J.K.

Free-spirited widow Florence Green (Emily Mortimer) risks everything to open a bookshop in a conservative East Anglian coastal town.

Somewhere in a clam bar, there's the sad waitress Ginny, a one-time actress and now a suffering wife who's been given a second chance by the side of the well-intentioned but uncouth carousel operator, Humpty. On the other hand, there's Humpty's 26-year-old estranged daughter, Carolina, who left the familial nest and a preordained future seeking adventure as a mobster's wife; only to return home with her wings broken, begging for forgiveness.

550,8. Singularity,2017,"Earth 2020, 3/4 of it's households have a robot. The AI supercomputer, Kronos, considers humans the biggest threat to Earth. A century later, few humans are left. Calia seeks the last human stronghold as does Kronos. In 2020, Elias van Dorne (John Cusack), CEO of VA Industries, the world's largest robotics company, introduces his most powerful invention--Kronos, a super computer designed to end all wars. When Kronos goes online, it quickly determines that mankind, itself, is the biggest threat to world peace and launches a worldwide robot attack to rid the world of the ""infection"" of man. Ninety-seven years later, a small band of humans remain alive but on the run from the robot army. A teenage boy, Andrew (Julian Schaffner) and a teenage girl, Calia (Jeannine Wacker), form an unlikely alliance to reach a new world, where it is rumored mankind exists without fear of robot persecution. But does this world actually exist? And will they live long enough to find out? 2020. It's been three years since VA Industries, led by genius Elias Van Dorne, revolutionized the way humans live with VA supplied robots now in three-quarters of all the world's households. In a misstep, VA got into the business of military robots in the wanted goal of world peace, with the exact opposite occurring in the robots having led to greater and more violent war. Now, Van Dorne has come up with an artificial intelligence called Kronos which he believes is the ultimate in robotics. In the mysterious worldwide broadcast launching Kronos which Van Dorne has not yet divulged what it is to do or accomplish, Van Dorne unleashes Kronos on the world, it which is to destroy the human race, which Kronos has determined is the cause of the world's problems. Van Dorne has uploaded a virtual version of himself and his colleague Damien Walsh into Kronos to oversee its progress on the mission to eliminate the human race. Fast forward to 2117. There are still pockets of humans who have been able to evade Kronos, the current survivors descendants of those who were able to survive in 2020. Purportedly, the largest pocket of resistance is in Aurora, its location which Kronos does not know. As such, Van Dorne, through Kronos, has created a robot in the form of a young human man to locate Aurora. He has created it the form and memory of a man who was in existence in 2020, Andrew Davis, the robot which truly does believe it is Andrew Davis with his memories. The robot is to befriend a young resistance fighter, Calia, who is trying to locate Aurora herself. Complications ensue as Van Dorne has created a robot arguably more human than humans themselves, that robot of Andrew which may ultimately work on his own human driven emotions.—Huggo",3.6,N/A,"Julian Schaffner,John Cusack,Carmen Argenziano,Eileen Grubba,Jeannine Michèle Wacker,Pavlo Bubryak,Paul American,David Chrisman,Hrncir Kuba,Elisa Dvorakova,Oliver Czavar,Michelle Michaels,Jason Marnocha,Elaine Loh,Ego Nwodim,Philipp Borchhardt,Olga Danielova,Daniel Kafka,Michael Kolar,Jakub Horák,Frantisek Dvorák,Vojta Hulka,Miroslav Hofman,Petr Dvorak,Barbora Danielova,Sylva Tikalova,Lukas Mihula,Robert Kouba Senior,Robert Kouba,Naj Modak,Klemens Niklaus Trenkle",PG-13,Robert Kouba,"GEM Entertainment,Culture Publishers (CP),Phars Film,EuroVideo,EuroVideo,Film1,Mongrel Media,Thunderbird Releasing,Vertical Entertainment,Volga","Calanda Pictures,Vantis Pictures,Voltage Pictures","Action,Adventure,Drama,Sci-Fi",92

562,20. The Man Who Invented Christmas,2017,"The journey that led to Charles Dickens' creation of ""A Christmas Carol,"" a timeless tale that would redefine Christmas. In 1843, celebrated British novelist Charles Dickens is at a low point in his career with three flops behind him and family expenses piling up at home. Determined to recover, Dickens decides to write a Christmas story and self-publish it in less than two months. As Dickens labors writing on such short notice, his estranged father and mother come to bunk with him. Still haunted by painful memories of his father ruining his childhood by his financial irresponsibility, Dickens develops a seemingly-unsolvable writer's block. Dickens must face his personal demons epitomized through his characters, especially in his imagined conversations with Ebenezer Scrooge. With a looming deadline, Dickens struggles for inspiration against his frustrations and his characters' opinions in a literary challenge creating a classic tale that would define the essential soul of modern Christmas.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Two years after the success of ""Oliver Twist,"" Charles Dickens is suffering financial hardship from the failure of his last three books. Rejected by his publishers, he sets out to write a new book to restore his finances. Seeing inspiration around London, most notably a rich man's funeral that is largely unattended, he begins writing ""A Christmas Carol,"" due in six weeks in order to be published by Christmas. As Charles begins to develop his story, he interacts with the characters he is writing about, most notably Ebenezer Scrooge. Helping Dickens is one of his servants, Tara, an Irish immigrant who is literate and able to provide advice. A fictional account of the creation of what has become a holiday classic. It's 1843, and Charles Dickens, who only less than a few years ago had enjoyed critical and public acclaim with Oliver Twist, is facing financial and legal troubles having had three subsequent failures in a row, with a seeming case of writer's block to boot. Gathering inspiration from things happening around him, he thinks he has the germ of an idea in seeing who looks to be a wealthy man with the attitude of a grouch, who has no reason for being such so close to Christmas. The problem is that Charles' publishers aren't too keen on a Christmas themed book, Christmas a minor holiday at best, and that to capitalize on Christmas, the book would have to be completed, including printed and distributed, within six weeks. As he continues to gather inspiration from events happening around him, Charles is guided in the physical world, much to the quiet consternation of his faithful wife Kate, by Tara, his Irish housemaid who he learned is quite well-read, and in the metaphysical world by the spirit of the story's central character, a wealthy but mean man named Scrooge, whose entrance into his psyche is complete with a Greek chorus of sorts. His writing is hindered by his parents' arrival: his father, John Dickens, with whom he has long had issue in his mismanagement of the family finances while Charles was growing up, a behavior that hasn't visibly changed. But the biggest issue in getting a completed manuscript to his satisfaction is that Scrooge seems to have a mind of his own against what Charles wants, which makes him question his ability as a writer and which only intensifies his temperamental nature.—Huggo In 1843, despite the fact that Dickens (Stevens) is a successful writer, the failure of his latest book puts his career at a crossroads, until the moment when, struggling with inspiration and confronting reality with his childhood memories, a new character is born in the depths of his troubled mind; an old, lonely, embittered man (Plummer), so vivid, so human, that a whole world grows around him, a story so inspiring that changed the meaning of Christmas forever.",7.0,,"Dan Stevens,Mark Schrier,Patrick Joseph Byrnes,Miriam Margolyes,Morfydd Clark,Justin Edwards,Cosimo Fusco,Jasper Hughes Cotter,James Heffernan,Aleah Lennon,Ella Mai Delaney,Donna Marie Sludds,David McSavage,Ian McNeice,Miles Jupp,Pat Mooney,Anna Murphy,Jonathan Pryce,Ely Solan,Ger Ryan,Sam McGillicuddy,Rory O'Neill,Nancy Quinney,Alanna Manning,Glynis Casson,Amelia Crowley,Bill Paterson,Derek Hannay,Derek O'Sullivan,John Delaney,Christopher Plummer,Gerard Lee,Stephen Ball,Martin Philips,Donald Sumpter,Kevin McCormack,Aideen Wylde,Simon Callow,Katie McGuinness,Marcus Lamb,Pearse Kearney,Paul Kealyn,Richard Coombs,Michael Judd,Eddie Jackson,Anthony Morris,John Henshaw,Annette Badland,Linda Gough,Jack Gunning,Christina Martina,Ava May Taylor,Adam Dolan,Cameron Simpson,Degnan Geraghty,John Colleary,Seán Duggan,Jake,James Daniel Wilson,George,Valeria Bandino,Desmond Bird,Séamus Hanly,Samantha Kelly,Franco Moscon,Mark Quigley,Fabiano Roggio,Roisin Whelan",PG,Bharat Nalluri,"GEM Entertainment,Film & TV House,Bleecker Street Media,KSM,Notorious Pictures,Phars Film,Shaw Organisation,Star Channel Movies,Thunderbird Releasing,Tohokushinsha Film Corporation (TFC),Cinemundo,Cosmote Cinema,Disney Channel,Disney+,Disney+,Eagle Films,Elevation Pictures,Net5,New KSM,New KSM,Notorious Pictures,Notorious Pictures,RSI-Radiotelevisione Svizzera,TV8","The Mazur Kaplan Company,The Mob Film Company,Ingenious Media,Nelly Films,Parallel Films,Rhombus Media","Biography,Comedy,Drama",104

567,2. The Greatest Showman,2017,"Celebrates the birth of show business and tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation. Orphaned, penniless, but ambitious and with a mind crammed with imagination and fresh ideas, the American entertainer, Phineas Taylor Barnum, will always be remembered as the man with the gift to blur the line between reality and fiction. Thirsty for innovation and hungry for success, the son of a tailor manages to open a wax museum; however, he soon shifts focus to the unique and the peculiar, introducing extraordinary, never-seen-before live acts on the circus stage. Now, some people call Barnum's rich collection of oddities, an outright freak show; but, when Phineas, obsessed for cheers and respectability, gambles everything on the opera singer, Jenny Lind, to appeal to a high-brow audience, he will lose sight of the most crucial aspect of his life: his family. Will Barnum, the greatest showman, risk it all to be accepted?—Nick Riganas In the late 19th century, P. T. Barnum and his troupe perform a show at the circus (""The Greatest Show""). In a flashback to Barnum's childhood where he and his father Philo, a tailor, work for the Hallett family, he becomes infatuated with their daughter, Charity. Charity explains that her father is sending her to finishing school, and she does not know what her future will be, but Barnum explains that he expects great things from his future, and reassures her that they will not be separated. The two keep in touch through letters until they meet again in adulthood (""A Million Dreams""), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City (""A Million Dreams"" reprise). They live a humble life; though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more. The true story of how one man changed the complete outlook of live entertainment. He travels and searches for multiple different talents to join the show. At the same time, he does the best that he can do for his family to survive the tough times that they are in.—RECB3 Musical dramatization of the life of Phineas Taylor Barnum, better known as P.T. Barnum and best known for being one half of the partnership of Barnum and Bailey Circus. Always one for spectacle in its broadest sense, he, able to secure a loan on a lie, begins his show business enterprises opening a museum of wax curiosities, which morphs, stemming from his daughters' suggestion to add something ""live"", into a circus featuring the wax curiosities in their live versions, who at the time were considered freaks in one aspect or another. It would take some convincing by Barnum to his performers that he was not solely taking advantage of them but was celebrating their differences from the norm. The son of a poor tailor, he also wanted to gain the respectability associated with the wealthy. It became importantly so in marrying socialite Charity née Hallett whose father in particular did not approve of him in Barnum's father having worked for him. Striving for that respectability leads to his collaborations with famed playwright Phillip Carlyle, and Jenny Lind, in some circles considered the greatest vocalist of her generation. But it is trying to reconcile that lowbrow circus life with that respectability that proved problematic for him, both professionally and personally.—Huggo",7.5,"$84,000,000 (estimated)","Hugh Jackman,Michelle Williams,Zac Efron,Zendaya,Rebecca Ferguson,Austyn Johnson,Cameron Seely,Keala Settle,Sam Humphrey,Yahya Abdul-Mateen II,Eric Anderson,Ellis Rubin,Skylar Dunn,Daniel Everidge,Radu Spinghel,Yusaku Komori,Danial Son,Paul Sparks,Will Swenson,Linda Marie Larson,Byron Jennings,Betsy Aidem,Damian Young,Tina Benko,Fredric Lehne,Kathryn Meisle,Timothy Hughes,Gayle Rankin,Arnie Burton,Carly Adams,Sawyer Niehaus,Shuler Hensley,Will Erat,James Andrew O'Connor,Jamie Jackson,Morgan Weed Whitley,Henry Stram,Michael Barra,Natasha Liu Bordizzo,Luciano Acuna Jr.,Shannon Freyer,Kevin Dwane,Sandi DeGeorge,Tony Neil Butler,Frances Emily Schramm,Kenneth Wong Chan,Stacey Alyse Cohen,Tim Wilson,Jonathon Culver,Jillian Braithwaite,Adam Haas Hunter,Bob Rumnock,Ben Reed,Martha Nichols,Jonathan Redavid,Shannon Holtzapffel,Jeremy Hudson,Taylor James,Chelsea Caso,Caoife Coleman,Mishay Petronelli,Khasan Brailsford,Alex Wong,Julius Rubio,Vincent-Oliver Noiseux,Sunny Walters,Ilia Jessica Castro,Najla Gilliam,Christina Glur,Emerson Tate Alexander,Victoria Llodra,Louise Hindsbo,Laci Justice,GiaNina Paolantonio,Rachel Quiner,Maddie Smith,Brando,Daniel 'Cloud' Campos,Rod Roberts,James Babson,Matthew Alexander,Loren Allred,Michael Angeloe,Marshall Axt,Nicole C.

570,5. Phantom Thread,2017,"Set in 1950s London, Reynolds Woodcock is a renowned dressmaker whose fastidious life is disrupted by a young, strong-willed woman, Alma, who becomes his muse and lover. In glamorous 1950s post-war London, renowned dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) are at the center of British fashion, dressing royalty, movie stars, heiresses, socialites, debutantes, and dames in the distinct style of The House of Woodcock. Women come and go through Woodcock's life, providing the confirmed bachelor with inspiration and companionship, until he comes across a strong-willed young woman, Alma (Vicky Krieps), who soon becomes a fixture in his life as his muse and lover. Once controlled and planned, he finds his carefully tailored life disrupted by love.—Focus Features In the dazzling world of glamour in 1950s London, Europe's most refined, most exquisite, most brilliant couturier, Reynolds Woodcock of The House of Woodcock, rests in his laurels, knowing that his artistic creations in lustrous silk and delicate chiffon are nothing less than objects of pure desire. However, everything is about to change in the favourite dressmaker's well-organised life, when a chance encounter with Alma, the charming and almost perfectly-proportioned young waitress, will strike a chord with Woodcock, embracing the bright-eyed woman as his new muse. But is Alma just another mannequin waiting next in line?—Nick Riganas In 1950s London, confirmed bachelor Reynolds Woodcock is a famed couturier, clothing the rich and famous. His business is a one-man-show on the design side. His genius can only be achieved within an environment which he controls to his complete sensibility. On the business side is his spinster sister, Cyril Woodcock, who maintains order within the household to allow Reynolds to work within his controlled environment. She will, however, not allow anything or anyone to upset the applecart, including Reynolds losing sight that it is a business, and not just a means to design and create fashions solely for his own satisfaction without regard for the clients. That balance in their work/live relationship has the potential to take a turn when Reynolds meets waitress Alma Elson. She not only becomes his muse but also his assistant and lover. Her entrance into his life and business changes the balance between Reynolds and Cyril, especially as Alma has her own sensibility of herself in Reynolds' life and in his business, which is often at odds with that control that Reynolds and Cyril have worked so hard to create and maintain.—Huggo In 1954 London, renowned fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock creates dresses for members of high society. His charisma and genius are matched by his obsessive, controlling personality. His sister Cyril manages the day-to-day operations of his fashion house and has significant influence over his life. Reynolds is haunted by their mother's death and stitches hidden messages into the linings of the dresses he makes. After designing a new gown for a revered client, the Countess, Reynolds visits a restaurant in the countryside and becomes interested in a waitress, Alma. He asks her to have dinner with him, and she accepts. Their relationship develops, and she moves in with him, becoming his model, muse, and lover.

571,6. The Post,2017,"A cover-up spanning four U.S. Presidents pushes the country's first female newspaper publisher and her editor to join an unprecedented battle between press and government. When American military analyst, Daniel Ellsberg, realizes to his disgust the depths of the US government's deceptions about the futility of the Vietnam War, he takes action by copying top-secret documents that would become the Pentagon Papers. Later, Washington Post owner, Kay Graham, is still adjusting to taking over her late husband's business when editor Ben Bradlee discovers the New York Times has scooped them with an explosive expose on those papers. Determined to compete, Post reporters find Ellsberg himself and a complete copy of those papers. However, the Post's plans to publish their findings are put in jeopardy with a Federal restraining order that could get them all indicted for Contempt. Now, Kay Graham must decide whether to back down for the safety of her paper or publish and fight for the Freedom of the Press. In doing so, Graham and her staff join a fight that would have America's democratic ideals in the balance.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Leaked to the New York Times by the American military analyst, Daniel Ellsberg, the Pentagon Papers--the top-secret study about the United States involvement in the Vietnam War and the decades of cover-ups--stir up a nationwide controversy in 1971. As the Nixon administration and the former Secretary of Defence, Robert McNamara, try to silence the shocking revelations, the Times' rival, the Washington Post, and its owner, Kay Graham, wrestle with the amplitude of a devastating decision. Should Graham publish and let the truth shine on the nearly 60,000 lost-in-action Americans? Should she put in jeopardy not only her status but also her paper?—Nick Riganas In 1971, The New York Times has access to classified documents about the Vietnam War. However, the government uses the justice department to stop the distribution of newspapers claiming violation of the national security laws. Immediately after, the Washington Post has access to similar documents but they decide to face the government and publish the newspapers against the will of their lawyers and investors.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 1966, during the Vietnam War, State Department military analyst Daniel Ellsberg accompanies American troops in combat, documenting the U.S. military progress in the region for Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. On the flight home, McNamara privately tells Ellsberg and William Macomber that the Vietnam war is hopeless. Upon landing, he tells the press he has every confidence in the war effort. Ellsberg, overhearing this, becomes disillusioned. Years later, as a civilian military contractor working for the RAND Corporation, Ellsberg surreptitiously photocopies hundreds of classified reports documenting the country's decades-long involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, dating back to the Truman administration. Ellsberg then leaks these documents to The New York Times..",7.2,"$50,000,000 (estimated)","Meryl Streep,Tom Hanks,Sarah Paulson,Bob Odenkirk,Tracy Letts,Bradley Whitford,Bruce Greenwood,Matthew Rhys,Alison Brie,Carrie Coon,Jesse Plemons,David Cross,Zach Woods,Pat Healy,John Rue,Rick Holmes,Philip Casnoff,Jessie Mueller,Stark Sands,Michael Cyril Creighton,Will Denton,Deirdre Lovejoy,Michael Devine,Kelly Miller,Jennifer Dundas,Austyn Johnson,Brent Langdon,Michael Stuhlbarg,Deborah Green,Gary Wilmes,Christopher Innvar,Luke Slattery,Justin Swain,Robert G.

576,11. Father Figures,2017,"Upon learning that their mother has been lying to them for years about their allegedly deceased father, fraternal twin brothers hit the road to search for him. Kyle and Peter Reynolds are fraternal twins who were raised by their mother, Helen, as their father died before they were born. Kyle has a pregnant girlfriend, Kaylani, and is wealthy from royalties for his image on BBQ sauce labels. Peter is divorced with a teenage son who resents him. Shortly after Helen's wedding, Peter recognizes an actor on ""Law and Order: SVU"" from photos of his supposed father, and confronts Helen. Helen explains that she had been promiscuous at the time of their conception and did not want their father involved. When they keep pressing, Helen reveals that their father is Terry Bradshaw. The brothers fly to Florida to meet Bradshaw at a signing event. Bradshaw is excited to have them as sons. As Bradshaw recounts stories with former teammate Rod Hamilton, the brothers realize that Bradshaw had been in Australia at the time of their conception, and thus isn't their father.. In middle age, fraternal twin brothers Peter and Kyle Reynolds could not be more different. Divorced Peter is uptight by nature. He realizes that he is unhappy with his life: he hasn't been with anyone since his divorce three years ago--from his college sweetheart and the only woman he had even been with, Katherine; he and his teenage son Ethan have never gotten along; he doesn't really like being a proctologist and had only become one to honor the supposed father who had died of colon cancer before he and Kyle were born. Ex-surfer Kyle is a free spirit living in Hawai'i, off the lucrative royalties from his image being used for a commercial Hawaiian barbecue sauce in the latest item in what seems to be his charmed life. He has never been married and is currently in a serious relationship with equally free spirit Kaylani. At the wedding of their mother Helen--her first since their father's passing, Peter and Kyle discover by chance that the stories Helen had told them about their father for all these years were all lies: she doesn't actually know who their father is.
