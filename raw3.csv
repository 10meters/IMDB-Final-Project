4,5. Eighth Grade,2018,"An introverted teenage girl tries to survive the last week of her disastrous eighth grade year before leaving to start high school. In his feature film directorial debut, comedian Bo Burnham deftly encapsulates the awkwardness, angst, self-loathing and reinvention that a teenage girl goes through on the cusp of high school. Given that the 27-year-old stand-up comic achieved fame as a teenager himself through YouTube by riffing on his insecurities, he is uniquely capable as the film's writer and director to tell the story of Kayla, an anxious girl navigating the final days of her eighth grade year, despite creating a protagonist female instead of male. Like Burnham did more than a decade ago, 13-year-old Kayla turns to YouTube to express herself, where she makes advice blogs in which she pretends to have it all together. In reality, Kayla is sullen and silent around her single father and her peers at school, carrying out most of her interactions with her classmates on Instagram and Twitter. Her YouTube videos are a clever narrative tool that provide insight into her inner hopes and dreams, much like an inspirational online diary. One of Eighth Grade's biggest triumphs is in its realism. Kayla Day is an eighth grade student finishing her final week at a public middle school in the state of New York. She posts motivational videos on YouTube about confidence and self-image that get almost no views. Struggling to make friends at school, she wins the ""Most Quiet"" award from her classmates. Meanwhile, Mark, her single father, struggles to connect with her and break her reliance on social media. She is invited to a pool party hosted by a classmate, Kennedy, who has done so only after being forced by her mother. At the party, Kayla has an anxiety attack in the bathroom but eventually goes outside to swim, where she meets Gabe, Kennedy's eccentric cousin. After trying to leave the party, Kayla has an awkward encounter with her crush, Aiden, who suggests that she rejoin the group.

Based on the story, the film includes interviews with the foursome who attempted the bizarre heist. Starring Barry Keoghan, Evan Peters, Blake Jenner, Jared Abrahamson and Ann Dowd. The storytelling frequently jumps between interviews with the real people portrayed in the film and the events themselves performed by actors. In 2003 in Lexington, Kentucky, Spencer Reinhard is an art student who feels his life has no meaning, that he needs something exciting, even if tragic, to happen in his life to inspire greater artistry. Warren Lipkais a rebellious student on an athletic scholarship, though he does not care much for sports and is only pursuing the education to please his family. After Spencer is given a tour of Transylvania University library's rare book collection, the two friends begin to plan to steal an extremely valuable edition of John James Audubon's The Birds of America and other rare books. Warren travels to Amsterdam to meet some black market buyers who express interest in buying the books. Upon returning to the US, he informs Spencer that they could make millions of dollars, much to their excitement.. There was nothing in their backgrounds that would suggest that the introverted art student, Spencer Reinhard, and his rebellious best friend, Warren Lipka, would have the guts to attempt and execute one of the most audacious art heists in US history with the help of partners-in-crime, Eric Borsuk and Chas Allen. Driven by the need to spice up their dull, predictable, and ordinary lives in Lexington, Kentucky, and in the process, make millions, the quartet of amateur robbers summons up the courage to break into the library of Transylvania University to steal a rare first edition of John James Audubon's Birds of America, and once there, throw in Charles Darwin's scientific theory, On the Origin of Species. However, lacking resources and previous experience, the boys' make-or-break scheme is on a collision course with disaster.—Nick Riganas In 2003, four Kentucky college students attempted to steal millions of dollars in rare books from the school library. The young men all hailed from comfortable upbringings, and were primarily motivated by wanting to feel special. They committed the heist during daylight, in the library's regular operating hours, using their exams as an alibi.",7.0,N/A,"Spencer Reinhard,Warren Lipka,Eric Borsuk,Chas Allen,Betty Jean Gooch,Evan Peters,Blake Jenner,Barry Keoghan,Jared Abrahamson,Eddie King,Karen Wheeling Reynolds,James Rackley,Drew Starkey,Anthony J.

11,12. Leave No Trace,2018,"A father and his seventeen-year-old daughter are living an ideal existence in a vast urban park in Portland, Oregon when a small mistake derails their lives forever. Will (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter, Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie), have lived off the grid for years in the forests of Portland, Oregon. When their idyllic life is shattered, both are put into social services. After clashing with their new surroundings, Will and Tom set off on a harrowing journey back to their wild homeland. The film is directed by Debra Granik from a script adapted by Granik and Anne Rosellini.—Bleecker Street After living off the grid in Oregon for years, traumatized military veteran Will (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter, Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie), are picked up by social services and forced to integrate back into society. While Tom begins to connect with others and thrive, Will struggles and attempts to avoid his demons by escaping back into the wild. Directed by Debra Granik. Based on the novel ""My Abandonment"" by Peter Rock. Will, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD, lives with his 13-year-old daughter, Tom, in a public park outside Portland, Oregon. They live in almost total isolation, only entering town for occasional food and supplies. Will makes their money by selling his VA-issued painkillers to other veterans. After Tom is accidentally spotted in the woods by a jogger, officers arrest them and place them into social services. They are given food and a house on a Christmas tree farm in rural Oregon, on the condition that Will abides by the rules of the home owner and social services. Will begrudgingly begins to work on the settlement packaging pine trees, while Tom begins school and interacts with local kids her age in a 4H club. Will feels oppressed by others' presence and tells Tom they are returning to the woods. She follows reluctantly. An emotionally broken veteran and his teen daughter have lived off the grid for many years on illegal national park land in Oregon and survived well, and happy. One day, they are found by park police and re-homed. He tries his best to make it work, taking a job on a Christmas tree farm, trading his labor for housing, but feels more comfortable working with the animals than the humans. She wants to stay, she's made a friend, sees what life is like in the ""real"" world, and wants to grow and evolve. Freedom calls him, and they disappear to another state to find peace again until he falls and is barely alive when found. While he is rehabbing his leg, she has the biggest decision of her life to make.—kateann1027",7.1,,"Thomasin McKenzie,Ben Foster,Jeffery Rifflard,Derek John Drescher,Michael Draper,Peter Simpson,Erik McGlothlin,Dana Millican,Alyssa McKay,Ryan Joiner,Michael J.

Former police officer Michael MacCauley, now a hard-working life-insurance salesman and caring family man, has been taking the commuter rail to New York for the past 10 years. Things take an unexpected turn when, on one of his daily journeys, cryptic passenger Joanna makes Michael a generous and tempting offer to locate a single commuter or face grave consequences.

14,15. Tully,2018,"A struggling mother of three forms an unexpected bond with the night nanny hired to help with her newborn baby. The film is about Marlo, a mother of three, including a newborn. Marlo's brother gives her a night nanny as a gift. Hesitant with the extravagance at first, Marlo comes to form a unique bond with the thoughtful, surprising, and sometimes challenging young nanny named Tully. Marlo, a mother of two, is pregnant with an unplanned third child. Jonah, her son, has a developmental disorder that doctors have been unable to diagnose; she uses the Wilbarger Protocol to brush his skin in an attempt to reduce his sensitivity. When Marlo and her husband Drew visit her wealthy brother Craig's house for dinner, he offers to pay for a night nanny as a baby shower gift, but Marlo rebuffs him. Marlo gives birth to a daughter she names Mia, and quickly becomes overwhelmed and exhausted. After Jonah's principal recommends that he be placed in a different school, Marlo breaks down, and she retrieves the contact information for the night nanny. Juggling weighty domestic responsibilities with Jonah, her emotionally needy five-year-old boy, the exhausted and pregnant mother of two, Marlo, is at the end of her tether. Then, the arrival of her newborn daughter, Mia, further complicates matters, and as if that weren't enough, Jonah's principal has an important announcement to make. As a result, unable to cope with the steep challenges of motherhood, Marlo accepts her wealthy brother's offer to gift her with the free-spirited twenty-six-year-old night nanny, Tully. Now, for the following three weeks, the too-good-to-be-true babysitter will be looking after the baby-girl from dusk till dawn, so that the overworked New York mum can finally get some rest, and maybe, just maybe, reacquaint with the lively woman she used to be. However, this is easier said than done. Who said parenthood is a walk in the park?—Nick Riganas Early forty-something Marlo is feeling overwhelmed in life. She has just given birth to her and her husband Drew's third child, Mia, the pregnancy unplanned, and Mia probably their last child in Marlo being close to the end of her fertile life. Marlo believes their oldest child, eight year old Sarah, needs her now more than ever in moving into a more grown up phase of her childhood. Their middle child, kindergarten student Jonah, is high maintenance, his behavioral problems which doctors have not been able to diagnose. Because of the disruptions Jonah makes in class, the school principal, Laurie, suggests that Jonah would benefit from a dedicated aide, all at Marlo and Drew's expense, such money they don't have in their middle class life. As such, Marlo has been searching the internet for home therapies in dealing with Jonah in the absence of therapists they can't afford. Drew and Marlo have a defined division of labor, Drew's responsibilities during this phase of their life which is focused more on being the breadwinner, his work which leaves Marlo with the bulk of the child rearing. As a baby gift, Marlo's well off brother and sister-in-law, Craig and Elyse, want to hire a night nanny for them, she who would do most of the baby care in the middle of the night while Marlo gets some much needed sleep. Initially resisting the idea in not wanting a stranger around, Marlo in her emotional breakdown, finally relents. Marlo ultimately comes to believe that the nanny, a young woman named Tully, is a godsend as she not only takes care of Mia, but believes that her responsibility is overall care for the family in they all being interconnected. Tully ends up being a sounding board for Marlo, the two who seem to have a certain symbiosis. However, Tully may be too much of of a good thing for this phase of Marlo's life.—Huggo",6.9,"$13,000,000 (estimated)","Charlize Theron,Mackenzie Davis,Ron Livingston,Asher Miles Fallica,Lia Frankland,Mark Duplass,Elaine Tan,Gameela Wright,Tattiawna Jones,Stormy Ent,Maddie Dixon-Poirier,Bella Star Choy,Dominic Good,Joshua Pak,Em Haine,Marceline Hugot,Colleen Wheeler,Jess Tolon,Katie Hayashida,Coyote Roberts,Elfina Luk,Xantha Radley,Michael Patrick Lane,John Shaw,Trish Allen,Candus Churchill,Jennifer March,Anne-Marie Madden,Diane Lane,Kevin Clash,Fran Brill,Kiff VandenHeuvel,Kitty Crystal,Shade Rupe,Johnny Serret",R,Jason Reitman,"Focus Features,ACME,ACME,ACME,Ascot Elite Entertainment Group,DCM Distribution,Diamond Films,Diamond Films,Diamond Films,Diamond Films,Finnkino,Kino Films,Mars Distribution,Paradise Group,Phars Film,Pris Audiovisuais,Remain In Light,Scanbox Entertainment,StudioCanal,Sundream Motion Pictures,Tanweer Alliances,United International Pictures (UIP),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures,Viva International Pictures,7flix,Eagle Films,M2 Films,Tanweer Alliances,The Searchers,The Searchers,Universal Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Nordic,Universum Film (UFA),Universum Film (UFA),Yleisradio (YLE)","BRON Studios,Right of Way Films,Denver and Delilah Productions,West Egg Studios,Creative Wealth Media Finance","Comedy,Drama,Mystery",95
15,16. Hotel Artemis,2018,"Set in riot-torn, near-future Los Angeles, 'Hotel Artemis' follows the Nurse, who runs a secret, members-only emergency room for criminals. On June 21, 2028, a riot breaks out in Los Angeles over the affordability and availability of water after it is privatized. Taking advantage of the distraction, a four-man crew of brothers Sherman and Lev and miscreants Buke and P-22 rob a bank. Unable to break into the vault, they steal from hostages at the bank, realizing that they were mainly staff of the wealthy sent to deposit valuables into the vault. Lev takes a male hostage's fancy pen despite being warned by the man not to. During their escape, an encounter with the police leaves P-22 dead and Buke and Lev critically wounded. They make their way to the nearby Hotel Artemis, a hotel/hospital that only treats criminals, run by Jean ""the Nurse"" Thomas. The Hotel only treats members who are paid-up in advance, so Sherman and Lev are allowed in while Buke as a non-member is kicked out by Everest, the Nurse's assistant. At the Hotel are two other guests. Code names for all guests are assigned based on the suite they are occupying. Sherman is code-named Waikiki, and Lev is code-named Honolulu. The other guests are code-named Acapulco, and Nice. The Nurse gets word from criminal Crosby Franklin that his father Orian ""The Wolf King"" Franklin, is en route and in need of immediate medical attention. Meanwhile, Waikiki catches up with Nice, who has moved on to work internationally while Waikiki has remained Stateside. When he reveals the pen his brother stole during the robbery, Nice explains that the pen is a mobile safe, and unlocks it to show it contains precious diamonds, saying they belong to the Wolf King, and reminding Waikiki that the Wolf King kills anybody who steals from him. To make matters worse, a wounded police officer named Morgan arrives outside begging for medical attention from Thomas.. Los Angeles, June 21st, 2028. While the streets are being torn apart by riots, the Nurse (Foster), who runs a clandestine hospital for criminals in the penthouse of the Artemis, a closed old hotel, has a rough night dealing with troublemaker clients: thieves, assassins, someone from the past and the one who owns the place and the whole city. In Los Angeles in the near future, the worst riots the city has ever seen have broken out, with many criminals taking advantage of such. In the process, many of those criminals are seriously injured. Some are able to take refuge at the Hotel Artemis, a secret member's only (i.e. prepaid) hospital solely for criminals, its owner hiring the no-nonsense Nurse twenty-two years ago when the facility opened, she not having stepped foot outside since in her agoraphobia due to the death of her son. The only other staff member on duty at this time is Everest, the orderly. There are strict rules in the hotel of which its members are well aware, such as no killing other members inside, no weapons and no guests for protection of the members in being both a refuge and care facility. The hotel seems to be verging on the brink of potential chaos as the riots get closer and closer, as those inside the hotel, not just relegated to the clients, are seemingly incompatible, and as long held secrets come to light.—Huggo",6.1,"$15,000,000 (estimated)","Jodie Foster,Sterling K.

28,5. Game Night,2018,"A group of friends who meet regularly for game nights find themselves entangled in a real-life mystery when the shady brother of one of them is seemingly kidnapped by dangerous gangsters. Married competitive gamer couple Max and Annie are trying to have a child, but their attempts are unsuccessful due to Max's stress surrounding his feelings of inadequacy when compared to his successful, attractive brother Brooks. During Max and Annie's routine weekend game night with their friends Ryan, and married couple Kevin and Michelle, Brooks shows up Max by arriving in a Corvette Stingray (Max's dream car) and sharing an embarrassing childhood story about Max. Brooks offers to host the next game night at a house he's renting while he's in town. Meanwhile, Max and Annie are trying to keep their game nights secret from their neighbor Gary, an awkward police officer after his divorce from their friend Debbie.. Married Max and Annie are individually and as a pair ultra-competitive in every aspect of life, especially in playing games, they having met when they were captains on competing teams at a bar trivia night. They routinely host game nights which include married Kevin and Michelle, who have been sweethearts for what seems like all their lives, and less than bright Ryan and whoever the latest dim bulb he is dating at any given time. These nights used to include Gary and Debbie until their divorce, intense Gary, a police officer who now lives next door to them, excluded in he never really having been *their* friend. Gary would be gutted if he knew for certain they still have the game nights without him in he considering them his best friends in return. Max's competitiveness extends to feelings toward his more successful brother, venture capitalist Brooks, the stress of feeling emasculated in the comparison which Annie believes is the reason for Max's low sperm count and they unable to conceive despite trying. That competitive streak hits a new level when Brooks returns to town wanting to host a game night of what he considers the next echelon of games, a murder mystery of sorts where he has hired a company specializing in organizing and enacting such, thus not even he knowing who may be actors entering their lives this evening. In what Max, Annie, Kevin, Michelle, Ryan and his surprisingly bright date Sarah initially believe is Brooks' admittedly great game in FBI agents and Bulgarian thugs with guns entering their lives, they all slowly come to the realization that who they are facing are real Bulgarian thugs with real guns filled with real bullets. They subsequently also come to the realization that one of the best ways to save themselves under this situation is to bring Gary back into their lives without him knowing what's going on, both items which may be easier said than done. Max and Annie necessarily evaluate their lives in the process.—Huggo Max and Annie's regular Game Nights take an unexpected twist when super-successful sibling Brooks throws a murder mystery party to end all murder mystery parties. After all, he has planned everything down to the last detail to provide genuine thrills. However, things soon go downhill when abduction enters the equation. And suddenly, the group realises this is much more than a typical competition. As they dive headlong into the challenge, shocking secrets and unexpected twists lead to a long night of thrilling chaos. At last, this contest is the event they've all been waiting for. Of course, the slightest mistake could also mean game over for everyone involved.—Nick Riganas",6.9,"$37,000,000 (estimated)","Jason Bateman,Rachel McAdams,Kyle Chandler,Sharon Horgan,Billy Magnussen,Lamorne Morris,Kylie Bunbury,Jesse Plemons,Michael C.

50,2. Upgrade,2018,"Set in the near-future, technology controls nearly all aspects of life. But when the world of Grey, a self-labeled technophobe, is turned upside down, his only hope for revenge is an experimental computer chip implant. Grey's a stay-at-home mechanic, whose wife is Asha. One day, Grey asks Asha to help him return a car to his client. Whilst Grey and Asha's self-driving car malfunctions, it crashes. Grey watches helplessly as Asha bleeds to death next to him. Grey returns home - a widowed quadriplegic, under the care of his mother. His wife's death and the inability of police to identify their attackers cause him to sink into a depression. After a suicide attempt, he's offered to have high tech chip implanted - enabling him to walk. Though initially hesitant, he's persuaded to have the surgery. In a not-so-distant future, where the machines have seamlessly integrated into the multifaceted aspects of our lives, the world relies almost entirely on technology to do even the most complicated tasks for us. As a result, more and more, the old-school, tech-shy car mechanic, Grey Trace, is feeling like a fish out of water; a stubbornly analogue man living in a brave new digital world. Then, suddenly, a terrible late-night incident robs Grey of his happiness, leaving him an empty quadriplegic. Now, the reclusive tech mogul, Eron Keen, comes up with an offer, promising Trace to bridge the painful gap between his unresponsive limbs and his brain with the aid of his latest, state-of-the-art invention: the powerful Stem microchip. But, what if the cure is worse than the disease?—Nick Riganas It's sometime in the near future. Grey Trace, in liking the tactile satisfaction of working with his hands in being a mechanic, has not embraced the technological revolution, unlike his wife Asha Trace, who works for one of the larger computer companies and who uses an electronically controlled, fully autonomous vehicle to get around. In a violent attack by a group against them, it happening even with technological safeguards to prevent such, Asha is killed and Grey rendered a quadriplegic. After months on the case with those technological advances providing little usable information, Police Detective Cortez has only had a few leads which seemingly have got her and, by association, Grey no closer to catching the perpetrators. Partly in a gesture as a friend, reclusive computer genius Eron Keen, one of Grey's customers, has developed a revolutionary new technology that he is calling Stem which he believes would alleviate Grey's physical disabilities. Not turning Grey into a robot, Stem instead would be a conduit between Grey's brain and his motor functions. Initially reluctant to go through with the procedure (to have Stem implanted) in not having anything to live for, Grey ultimately agrees, with Eron's caveat that Grey cannot tell anyone (Eron needing to keep the technology under wraps for the time being). Grey therefore leads a double life as a fully functioning human and a wheelchair bound quadriplegic. However, Grey discovers that Stem not only will allow him to walk again, but also to act in superhuman way. Stem, that can talk via a sound wave generated voice only to Grey, is an artificial intelligence that can take control of Grey upon Grey's okay. This development leads to a standoff of sorts between three people: Grey, while abhorring violence in its general nature, wants to use Stem to exact revenge against those who killed Asha (the attack against them appeared targeted as opposed to random); Detective Cortez who comes to believe that Grey, despite being confined to a wheelchair, is behind attacks perpetrated against people that were on her suspect list; and Eron who may want to shut down Stem if he discovers that Grey is using Stem for unauthorized purposes, such as vigilante acts by Grey which would indeed contravene their gentlemen's agreement.—Huggo Upgrade is a 2018 cyberpunk action film about a technophobe who receives a chip implant that allows him to control his body after a mugging leaves him paralyzed. The movie is set in a near-future where technology controls most aspects of life. The main character, Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green), is a mechanic who lives with his wife Asha (Melanie Vallejo) in a home where almost everything is controlled by technology. One day, Grey and Asha's self-driving car malfunctions and crashes, killing Asha and leaving Grey a quadriplegic. Grey's only hope for revenge is an experimental computer chip implant called ""Stem"" that a billionaire inventor offers him. The implant enhances Grey's body, allowing him to walk, and giving him superhuman strength and agility. Grey uses these new skills to seek revenge against the thugs who destroyed his life.—tpsimpleman",7.5,"$5,000,000 (estimated)","Logan Marshall-Green,Melanie Vallejo,Steve Danielsen,Abby Craden,Harrison Sloan Gilbertson,Benedict Hardie,Richard Cawthorne,Christopher Kirby,Richard Anastasios,Kenny Low,Linda Cropper,Betty Gabriel,Emily Havea,Ming-Zhu Hii,Simon Maiden,Stephanie Demkiw,Manjot Jassal,Esther Joseph,Sachin Joab,Matt Davis,Clayton Jacobson,Arthur Angel,Puven Pather,Ri-Jie Kwok,Dave Mondon,Rosco Campbell,Kai Bradley,Michael M.

51,3. Blockers,2018,"Three parents try to stop their daughters from losing their virginity on prom night. Single mother Lisa Decker drops off her young daughter, Julie, for her first day of kindergarten. She watches on as Julie is joined by two other girls, Kayla and Sam. Kayla's dad Mitchell and Sam's dad Hunter introduce themselves and become close friends after seeing the bond between their children.. In suburban Chicago, Great Lakes High School seniors Julie, Kayla and Sam, who have been best friends since they met the first day of their school life, are preparing for prom night. The parent that took each to school that first day - Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter respectively - had the potential to match their daughters' friendship, but it has not materialized in quite the same way. Despite brawny, sports-minded Mitchell - who nonetheless is prone to emotional tears - texting her to do things all the time with his wife Marcie, Lisa, the single mom who has devoted her entire being to only offspring Julie, quietly ignores those attempts to be buds for her own personal reasons. Julie and Mitchell don't as quietly ignore overgrown adolescent Hunter's messages, he who they have not kept in touch with since he and Sam's mother, Brenda, split. Hunter has generally been a non-existent part not only of the social circle around their daughters and their daughters' friends, but of Sam's life. Without telling their parents, the three girls have entered into a pact to lose her respective virginity on prom night, each having a different reason for wanting to lose her virginity that night. While Julie wants it to be a special night with her boyfriend of six months Austin, Kayla feels it's a rite-of-passage she will eventually go through, her prom date, Connor, as good a person as any. Sam, still in the closet to everyone, wants to feel part of the crowd and will go along with testing the straight waters with her date Chad, while she truly has her heart for Angelica, who is openly out. As the three couples head off on prom night, Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter learn of their daughters' pact, each who has his or her own reason to try and stop them. Lisa doesn't want Julie to make the same mistake she made with her first, Julie's father - who dropped out of her life shortly after their sexual encounter - that encounter which resulted in Julie. Lisa also does not want to lose Julie, who is the entire focus of her life. Mitchell is not emotionally ready for Kayla to do anything besides the sports related goals to be the best they have worked on together their entire lives. And Hunter, while wanting Sam to have a fun, sexual life, wants her to have it with someone of the correct gender, he deep in his heart knowing of Sam's homosexual orientation. The teen couples and Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter, as two groups, get into one misadventure after another as the parents try to track their daughters and their dates before they feel the girls will be making the biggest mistake of their young lives.—Huggo Three parents of three daughters who are best friends with each other do everything that they can to stop their daughters from losing their virginity on the night of their prom.

Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is the fiercely independent daughter of eccentric adventurer Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), who vanished when she was scarcely a teen. Now a young woman of twenty-one without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father's global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he's truly gone. Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can't understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death. Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her dad's last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the stakes couldn't be higher for Lara, who, against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith, and inherently stubborn spirit, must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown.

Centers on a young man living in the Pennsylvania backwoods caring for his three younger sisters after the shooting death of his abusive father and the arrest of his mother for that murder. Family secrets and unspoken truths threaten to consume him.—anonymous Harley Altmeyer has to care for his three sisters after his mother is placed in jail for killing his abusive father. Living in the coal town of Laurel Falls in the backwoods of Western Pennsylvania, Harley lusts after a mother of two who lives down the road.

95,23. Stockholm,2018,"Based on the absurd but true 1973 bank heist and hostage crisis in Stockholm that was documented in the New Yorker as the origins of the 'Stockholm Syndrome'. A semi-fictional account, including most of the names of the players being changed, of the event that resulted in the creation of the term Stockholm Syndrome to describe people who feel empathy and sometimes more for their captor(s) is presented. In 1973, a lone armed man, thought to be American, storms the downtown Stockholm branch of Kreditbanken. Ultimately the authorities, led by Chief of Police Mattsson learn of his at-gunpoint demand: $1 million US, the release of convicted bank robber and murderer Gunnar Sorensson, and a Mustang Boss 302 like the one Steve McQueen drove in Bullitt (1968) as a getaway vehicle for the two of them. By the time Mattsson gets Sorensson to the bank - unknown to the gunman, who is thought to be well known robber Kaj Hansson, Sorenson having made a plea deal with Mattsson for his cooperation against the gunman - there are three hostages at the bank, all the others that were in the bank at the time let go. Arguably the most lucid of the three is bank clerk Bianca Lind, a wife and mother of two preschool aged children. Ultimately she is able to figure out that the gunman is not Hansson as Mattsson suspects, but rather Lars Nystrom, what she knowing of his past crimes chief being his humane treatment of people he held at gunpoint. Beyond what Sorensson decides to do with his ultimate goal not to go back to prison, what happens largely depends on Lind, who begins to trust Nystrom more than either Mattsson or Prime Minister Olof Palme whose actions and decisions she believes from what she can see are more of a potential physical detriment to her and her fellow two hostages than that of Nystrom.—Huggo Stockholm, 1973. Dressed in a worn-out leather jacket, sporting a shaggy wig and a thick moustache, the die-hard Bob Dylan fan and armed-to-the-teeth ex-con, Lars Nystrom, takes over Kreditbank, the largest bank institution in the Swedish capital.

Adrift,2018,"A true story of survival, as a young couple's chance encounter leads them first to love, and then on the adventure of a lifetime as they face one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history. Starring Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin, Adrift is based on the inspiring true story of two free spirits whose chance encounter leads them first to love, and then to the adventure of a lifetime. As the two avid sailors set out on a journey across the ocean, Tami Oldham (Woodley) and Richard Sharp (Claflin) couldn't anticipate they would be sailing directly into one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history. In the aftermath of the storm, Tami awakens to find Richard badly injured and their boat in ruins. With no hope for rescue, Tami must find the strength and determination to save herself and the only man she has ever loved. Adrift is the unforgettable story about the resilience of the human spirit and the transcendent power of love.—STXfilms October 1983. Following the harrowing and heartbreaking story of Tami Ashcraft, and her kindred spirit, Richard Sharp, ""Adrift"" portrays the couple's 4,000-mile sailing trip from sunny Tahiti to San Diego. Assigned to deliver the 44-foot yacht, Hazana, to California, Richard and Tami will soon find themselves ambushed by a devastating category-four hurricane--fighting for survival against towering waves, and 140-mile-per-hour winds. In the end--with Richard badly injured, and their vessel severely damaged, and adrift--Tami must find the courage, and the strength, to keep themselves alive even if all hope seems lost.—Nick Riganas The film begins with Tami awakening on the sailing yacht Hazaña after being unconscious for some time. After regaining her memory that Richard did not come below with her, she searches the crippled yacht in hopes of finding her fiance Richard and soon realizes he has been swept overboard after his safety harness broke during the hurricane. Tami screams in anguish and it is revealed that Tami is all alone, with no ships or land in sight. Back to 1983 (five months before the catastrophic hurricane), Tami arrives in Tahiti on board the schooner Sofia and meets Richard Sharp, a British sailor. Richard then invites Tami for dinner on board his boat, named Mayaluga. During a conversation, while having dinner together, Richard reveals that he experiences hallucinations while at sea. Back in real-time, Tami is stranded on board a crippled Hazaña and finds out that all the electronic devices are ruined by water damage, preventing her from making distress calls. Tami spots the lost dinghy with Richard clinging onto it and tries to sail the ship towards Richard but to no avail. After falling off the yacht and almost drowning, Tami has no choice but to make repairs to the ship in order to get it moving. She makes a makeshift sail using a broken pole and a storm jib (a triangular sail). She also uses a pump to prevent the cabin from flooding and then makes her way towards Richard. After successfully saving Richard, Tami realizes that Richard has broken ribs and a shattered right shin. While searching for food supplies, Tami realizes that she has a severe head injury and stitches the wound with a sail needle and thread..",6.6,"$35,000,000 (estimated)","Shailene Woodley,Sam Claflin,Jeffrey Thomas,Elizabeth Hawthorne,Grace Palmer,Tami Ashcraft,Marisiale Tunoka,Kael Damlamian,Lei-Ming Caine,Neil Andrea,Apakuki Nalawa,Tim Solomon",PG-13,Baltasar Kormákur,"Cinemundo,Diamond Films,Golden Village Pictures,Kino Films,Metropolitan Filmexport,Mongkol Major,Odeon,SF Studios,SF Studios,STX Entertainment,STX International,TOBIS Film,Viva International Pictures,Westec Media Limited,Film & TV House,GEM Entertainment,Network 10,Odeon,The Searchers,The Searchers,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (UPHE),Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (UPHE),Universum Film (UFA),Universum Film (UFA),VVS Films,Volga","Huayi Brothers,Ingenious,RVK Studios,Lakeshore Entertainment,Pantagruel Productions,STX Entertainment","Action,Adventure,Biography,Drama,Romance,Thriller",96
108,11. Book Club,2018,"Four lifelong friends have their lives forever changed after reading 50 Shades of Grey in their monthly book club. Four longtime friends and book club members--Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen--have their lives upended when they aim to spice up their mundane routines by reading the provocative bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey. With newfound confidence, they each begin to come alive as exciting romances are ignited and old flames are rekindled. Through it all, the ladies inspire one other to make this next stage of their lives the best and steamiest thus far. Four women have attended a monthly book club for thirty years, where they bond over the suggested literature. Vivian, who owns and builds hotels, runs into Arthur, a man she turned down marriage to 40 years prior. They begin a flirtation, but Vivian has always refused to settle down because she enjoys her independence. Diane is recently widowed, and her daughters would like her to move closer to them in Arizona because they perceive her to be in danger because she's living alone. Sharon is a federal judge who's been single since she divorced her son's father over 15 years ago. Carol has a successful marriage to Bruce, who has recently retired but they have recently lacked intimacy. One day, they read Fifty Shades of Grey and are turned on by the content. Viewing it as a wake up call, they decide to expand their lives and chase pleasures that have eluded them. While flying to visit her daughters in Arizona, Diane meets Mitchell and they strike up a relationship, though Diane is hesitant because of how recently her late husband died and because she hasn't dated in decades. Vivian spends more time with Arthur, but because of her fear of commitment, she tries to keep him at a distance.. Angelenos Carol, Diane, Sharon and Vivian, in addition to being longtime best friends, comprise a book club formed by Diane thirty years ago, they who meet monthly to drink wine and discuss the book of the month chosen on a rotating basis by each of the four. When Vivian chooses Fifty Shades of Grey, the women are steered in the direction of examining their own sex, romantic and love lives as they move into the latter stages of their lives. Executive chef Carol is trying to insert spice into her marriage to her husband of thirty-five years Bruce, Carol who still craves intimacy and sex, both now non-existent, as Bruce, who she knows still loves her, seems more interested in other things besides her since his retirement six months ago. Widowed less than a year ago, Diane, whose marriage was a loving and stable one, is now coddled by her two Scottsdale residing adult daughters, Adrianne and Jill, who treat her more as a helpless child than their capable mother, and who want her to move into Adrianne's basement suite so that they can better take care of her. As such, Diane feels the need to hide from them that for the first time since being widowed, she has met a man, airline pilot Mitchell, who she may want to be a big part of her future if he is given the opportunity. Federal judge Sharon has been divorced for eighteen years from Tom, and while she doesn't miss him, she misses what he represented to her as demonstrated by the fact that she has not had sex with anyone else in all those years. Her three friends egg her on to explore the sometimes treacherous world of online dating. And hotelier Vivian has never looked for love in feeling such would impede her independence as she is content with her life with a proverbial stableful of casual sexual partners. Vivian is reunited with New York residing Arthur, a former lover, when he checks into her hotel. While Arthur seemingly tries to steer their new relationship into a serious one, Vivian in turn tries to maintain what she considers her sense of freedom and independence.—Huggo",6.1,"$10,000,000 (estimated)","Diane Keaton,Jane Fonda,Candice Bergen,Mary Steenburgen,Andy Garcia,Craig T.

While the Parr family has accepted its collective calling as superheroes, the fact remains that their special heroism is still illegal. After they are arrested after unsuccessfully trying to stop the Underminer, their future seems bleak. However, the wealthy Deavor siblings of Devtech offer new hope with a bold project to rehabilitate the public image and legal status of Supers, with Elastigirl being assigned on point to be the shining example. Having agreed for now to stay home to look after the kids, Mr. Incredible finds domestic life a daunting challenge, especially when baby Jack-Jack's newly-emerged powers make him almost impossible to manage. However, Elastigirl has her own concerns dealing with the menace of a new supervillain, Screenslaver, who is wreaking havoc with his mind-control abilities.

127,5. Tag,2018,"A small group of former classmates organize an elaborate, annual game of tag that requires some to travel all over the country. Childhood friends Jerry (Jeremy Renner), Callahan (Jon Hamm), Randy (Jake Johnson), Sable (Hannibal Buress) and Hoagie (Ed Helms) have been competing in the same game of tag for 30 years. When Jerry gets married, he attempts to retire from the intense annual game without ever being ""it,"" causing the other four to band together and go to extreme lengths to finally tag him. Directed by Jeff Tomsic. Inspired by the Wall Street Journal article ""It Takes Planning, Caution to Avoid Being It."" Hogan ""Hoagie"" Malloy, Bob Callahan, Randy ""Chilli"" Cilliano, Kevin Sable and Jerry Pierce have been playing tag since they were nine years old, starting in 1983, during the month of May. Since then, the group's main rule of the game is that the last one tagged is ""it,"" until next season. With Hoagie having been the last one tagged in the previous year, he first recruits Bob, the CEO of an insurance company, and then Chilli and Kevin for one last attempt to tag Jerry, who has seemingly never been tagged because of his strong athleticism and intelligence. Hoagie tells them that Jerry plans to retire after this year's game because of his upcoming marriage. Rebecca Crosby, a Wall Street Journal reporter doing a piece on Bob, joins them and decides to write an article on the friends. They are also accompanied by Hoagie's wife Anna. Once they arrive at their hometown of Spokane, Washington, they locate Jerry at the local country club where he will be getting married, but they are overwhelmed by Jerry's skill. Jerry then introduces his fiancee Susan. As the others express disappointment over not being invited to the wedding despite their close relationship, Jerry knew he would almost certainly be tagged or at least targeted during the ceremonies. They agree to not play the game at any wedding-related events in exchange for invitations to the wedding. Despite this, the group makes several attempts to tag Jerry both before and right after wedding-related events.. Shockingly based on a true story, the film follows a group of friends who, throughout their entire childhood lives and continuing on into their adulthood, have been playing the same, continuous game of tag every year. However, for this year, they're planning something very special for one of their friends, Jerry. You see, Jerry hasn't been tagged by any of his friends yet and this streak is what the guys are aiming to break. With Jerry having plans on marrying his fiancee and retiring from the game altogether, his friends make it their ultimate mission to tag him once and for all.—Affan Jamsari",6.5,"$28,000,000 (estimated)","Ed Helms,Lil Rel Howery,Jon Hamm,Annabelle Wallis,Jake Johnson,Isla Fisher,Hannibal Buress,Nora Dunn,Steve Berg,Jeremy Renner,Leslie Bibb,Rashida Jones,Indiana Sifuentes,Trayce Malachi,Jock McKissic,Thomas Middleditch,Al Mitchell,Sebastian Maniscalco,Kate Kneeland,Vince Pisani,Kurt Yue,Brayden Benson,Tyler Crumley,Legend Williams,Braxton Bjerken,Braxton Alexander,Th'Yana Star,Maxwell Ross,Xavion Shelton,Jaren Lewison,Elijah Marcano,Kella Raines,Kevin Moody,Jim Esposito,Loren Lott,Andrew Tran,John Jacob Anderson,Allie Arasi,Linda Bochenek,Courtney Brown,Carrie Brownstein,Lucie Carroll,Marisol Correa,Vinny Costa,Adelynn Cuevas,McCall Dawson,Matthew Del Bene,Brian Dennehy,Laura Distin,Sharon Frank,Curtis Gammage,Sandy Givelber,Herschel Grangent Jr.,Kyle Jackson,Deedra Jordan,Léland Downs Karas,Samantha Kelly,Jeremiah Krage,Melissa LeEllen,William Liles,Monica Mathis,Sarah Miller,Edward Parker,Josiah Paul,Mason Pike,Grace Pippas,Tatum Price,Chuck Rayner,Patti Schellhaas,Leslie Sides,Joey Thurmond,William G.

159,12. The First Purge,2018,"America's third political party, the New Founding Fathers of America, comes to power and conducts an experiment: no laws for 12 hours on Staten Island. No one has to stay on the island, but $5,000 is given to anyone who does. This horror/action-adventure film from director Gerard McMurray serves as a prequel that recounts events that led up to the first Purge event. To push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community. A crazed drug addict named Skeletor talks on camera about his dark thoughts, including his desire to ""purge"" and unleash his hatred on other people. An unknown voice on the other end of the camera tells Skeletor that he will soon be able to. Sometime in the 21st century, turmoil has caused the government to be overthrown by the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA). NFFA members Arlo Sabian and Dr. May Updale announce an experiment to take place on Staten Island where for 12 hours, citizens will be allowed to purge and release their inhibitions in any way they choose. The NFFA offers residents of the Island $5000 to stay in their homes during the experiment and a compensation for those participating as well. They also outfit the participants with tracking devices and contact lenses with cameras in them so that they can monitor all activity. Drug lord Dmitri tells his dealers that they will be leaving but drug dealer Capital A wants to stay and purge. Another young drug dealer, Isaiah, gets into a fight with Skeletor and gets his neck cut. Isaiah goes to his sister Nya, an anti-Purge activist and Dimitri's ex-girlfriend, for treatment, and Nya later confronts Dmitri as she believes that Dmitri is Isaiah's drug lord, which he denies.. This is the fourth installment in the Purge franchise and a prequel showing how the United States came to the point of accepting the Purge Night. It shows how it originated as an experiment confined to Staten Island with the promise that those who stay on the island for its duration will be paid a large sum of money.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com",5.2,"$13,000,000 (estimated)","Y'lan Noel,Lex Scott Davis,Joivan Wade,Mugga,Patch Darragh,Marisa Tomei,Luna Lauren Velez,Kristen Solis,Rotimi Paul,Mo McRae,Jermel Howard,Siya,Christian Robinson,Steve Harris,Derek Basco,D.K.

It seems to the Teens that all the major superheroes out there are starring in their own movies-everyone but the Teen Titans, that is. But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation, and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick. If only they could get the hottest Hollywood film director to notice them. With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream.

The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line.—Warner Bros.

Directed by Aaron Horvath and Peter Rida Michail. In Jump City, the Teen Titans arrive to stop the Balloon Man. When he cannot figure out who they are, the Teen Titans jump into a rap song to introduce themselves and become distracted, forcing the Justice League to intervene. They criticize the Titans for being childish, not taking anything seriously, and bring up the fact that they do not have a movie of their own to prove their legitimacy. While at the premiere of Batman Again after Raven sent the Challengers of the Unknown to another dimension, Robin humiliates himself, after assuming that there will be a movie about him, and is laughed out by the audience.

Rachel Chu, an American-born Chinese NYU professor, travels with her boyfriend, Nick, to his hometown in Singapore for his best friend's wedding. Before long, his secret is out: Nick's family is wealthy, and he's considered the most eligible bachelor in Asia. Every single woman is incredibly jealous of Rachel and wants to bring her down.—JAP Native New Yorker Rachel Chu goes with her boyfriend, Nick Young, to his best friend's wedding in Singapore. Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick's family, Rachel's unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about himself.—Warner Bros. Chinese-American New Yorker Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) travels to Singapore with her boyfriend Nick Young (Henry Golding) to attend his best friend's wedding and discovers that he comes from one of Asia's most wealthy, prominent families. A commoner among the social elite, Rachel becomes a target for single women vying for Nick's attention, as well as for his judgmental mother Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh), who wants nothing more than to break them up. Directed by Jon M. Chu. Based on the novel of the same name by Kevin Kwan. After dating for a year and becoming serious, Rachel Chu, an Economics Professor specializing in game theory at NYU, and her boyfriend Nick Young, who have a modest existence as per their income, are traveling to Singapore for the wedding of Nick's best friend Colin and his fiancée Araminta. The trip will be the first time Rachel will meet Nick's Asia-residing friends and family; he grew up in Singapore and has only spoken of his family in general terms. As she gets closer and closer to meeting Nick's family, Rachel slowly realizes that he comes from an extremely wealthy background. He has never mentioned anything about this and his life in New York has never shown any indication that his family is old-money and one of the most powerful families in Singapore. Rachel finds that her time in Singapore is like a fishbowl, especially on the speculation of who Nick, the most sought-after of Singapore bachelors, would marry. She also finds that many people in Nick's Singaporean circle are against her being in his life; at the top of this list is his mother Eleanor; she blames Rachel not only for Nick not returning home a year earlier like he had planned, but also that Rachel might not be appropriate support to Nick's heir-apparent role as head of the Young Corporation. With some of Nick's friends and family on her side, specifically his cousin Astrid who married outside of their class for love, and her main support in Singapore being her new-money college friend Peik Lin Goh, Rachel must decide whether the situation with NIck's family is worth fighting, or if the price for Nick is too high for her to be in his life in the long term.—Huggo",6.9,"$30,000,000 (estimated)","Constance Wu,Henry Golding,Michelle Yeoh,Gemma Chan,Lisa Lu,Awkwafina,Harry Shum Jr.,Ken Jeong,Sonoya Mizuno,Chris Pang,Jimmy O.

Set against the backdrop of 19th-century post-Civil War America, where life was cruel and cheap, the stories of six different people, united by death, unfold. Starting with ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"", cheerful Buster Scruggs, the deadly gunslinger with a lighting-fast right hand and a lovely singing voice, is about to discover that talent alone is not enough. Next up in ""Near Algodones"", an ambitious bank robber has a rendezvous with the gallows, and in ""Meal Ticket"", an aging traveling impresario goes the extra mile to grab the audience's attention. Following, in ""All Gold Canyon"", an unsuccessful, silver-haired prospector is convinced that his luck is going to change in the middle of nowhere. Then, in ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"", beautiful Alice finds out that romance and stray bullets don't mix.

177,6. The Favourite,2018,"In early 18th-century England, the status quo at the court is upset when a new servant arrives and endears herself to a frail Queen Anne. In the early 18th century, England is at war with France; nevertheless, duck-racing and pineapple-eating are thriving. A frail Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) governs the country in her stead while tending to Anne's ill health and mercurial temper. When new servant Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah. Sarah takes Abigail under her wing and Abigail sees a chance at a return to her aristocratic roots. As the politics of war become quite time-consuming for Sarah, Abigail steps into the breach to fill in as the Queen's companion. Their burgeoning friendship gives her a chance to fulfill her ambitions and she will not let woman, man, politics, or rabbit stand in her way.—Fox Searchlight Pictures In early 18th-century England, against the backdrop of the costly War of the Spanish Succession, Abigail Hill, a mud-covered former aristocrat, arrives at the palace to beg for a job. Instead, Abigail finds the ailing Queen Anne mostly tending to her furry herd of rabbits, replaced by Sarah Churchill, the petulant monarch's faithful confidante and the one subtly running the country. But fortune favours the bold. And soon, the castle's newest scullery maid spots a golden opportunity to restore her status. As the ferocious antagonists vie for the attention of the sad empress, rapacious ambition, creative emotional manipulation, and hidden personal agendas get in the way. After all, only one can win the coveted title of the lonely ruler's intimate. So, what will it take for the silent rivals to become Queen Anne's all-time favourite?—Nick Riganas The power dynamic among three women in the royal house of England in the early 18th century is presented during a time when England is at war with France. The first is Queen Anne, the current ruler. She tries to overcome her insecurities, paranoia, and potential perceived weakness in being lame by that outward power of being ruler. The second is Sarah, Lady Marlborough, the Queen's trusted lady-in-waiting and the wife to Lord Marlborough, the head of the British military. The third is Abigail Hill, Sarah's cousin, whose family has fallen on hard times; Sarah hires her to work in the royal palace in various domestic roles. The Queen's motivation is to appear that she is in charge while desperately wanting to feel loved by those whom she loves. Sarah's motivation is to implement her desired policies, especially with regard to the war. Abigail's motivation is to regain her status as a lady in not wanting to feel at the mercy of poverty ever again. Others try to exploit this dynamic, especially Harley, the leader of the opposition in Parliament, who doesn't feel that he has the Queen's ear at this important time of war.—Huggo In the early 18th century, Queen Anne is the monarch of England. Her closest friend, confidante, and advisor is Lady Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. Lady Sarah's cousin Abigail comes to the palace, hoping for a job. She used to have status but has fallen on hard times. With Lady Sarah's help Abigail gets a job as a maid, but her ambitions are much higher than. that.—grantss",7.5,"$15,000,000 (estimated)","Olivia Colman,Rachel Weisz,Emma Delves,Faye Daveney,Emma Stone,Paul Swaine,Jennifer White,Lilly-Rose Stevens,Denise Mack,James Smith,Mark Gatiss,Horatio,Willem Dalby,Edward Aczel,Carolyn Saint-Pé,John Locke,Nicholas Hoult,Everal A Walsh,Basil Eidenbenz,Declan Wyer,Anthony Dougall,James Melville,Timothy Innes,Joe Alwyn,Ben English,Wilson Mbomio,Peter Leon Brookes,Gavin Henderson,Djordje Jovanovic,Sam Kemp,Hana McDowell,James Perrin,Luca Wiseman,Callum Lewin,Jenny Rainsford,Liam Fleming,Angela Hicks,Martin Pemberton,Isaura Barbé-Brown,Alexis Bennett,Samuel Bossman,Antonia Castilla,Solomon Jericho Charles,Errol Clayton,Leigh Dent,Chris Elms,Frank Gordon,Tim Ingall,Elizabeth Ita,Ethan Keaton,Phelim Kelly,Roisin Keogh,Nathan Lang,Poppy Lawless,Keith Milner,Hannah Morley,Alfrun Rose,Laura-Jayne Ross,Kemal Shah,Janette Sharpe,Luke Thallon,Jack Veal,Emily Vinnicombe,Zenobia Voegele-Downing,Paul Wingrove",R,Yorgos Lanthimos,"Fox Searchlight Pictures,Twentieth Century Fox,Ukrainian Film Distribution (UFD),Twentieth Century Fox,20th Century Fox Argentina,20th Century Fox,Big Picture 2 Films,Forum Hungary,Nordisk Film Distribusjon,Odeon,TME Films,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Twentieth Century Fox,Warner Bros.,20th Century Fox Home Entertainment,20th Century Fox Home Entertainment,20th Century Fox Home Entertainment,20th Century Fox Home Entertainment,7flix,Seven Network","Fox Searchlight Pictures,Film4,Waypoint Entertainment,Element Pictures,Scarlet Films,TSG Entertainment,Investment Incentives for the Irish Film Industry Provided by the Government of Ireland,BFI Film Fund,Bord Scannán na hÉireann / The Irish Film Board","Biography,Comedy,Drama,History",119

181,10. First Man,2018,"A look at the life of the astronaut, Neil Armstrong, and the legendary space mission that led him to become the first man to walk on the Moon on July 20, 1969. A Biopic on the life of the legendary American Astronaut Neil Armstrong from 1961-1969, on his journey to becoming the first human to walk the moon. Exploring the sacrifices and costs on the Nation and Neil himself, during one of the most dangerous missions in the history of space travel.—Matthew Villella In 1961, NASA test pilot Neil Armstrong is flying the X-15 rocket plane when it inadvertently bounces off the atmosphere. Although he manages to land the plane in the Mojave Desert, his colleagues express concern that his recent record of mishaps is due to distraction and he is grounded. His two-and-a-half year old daughter, Karen, is undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. Desperate to save her, Armstrong keeps a detailed log of her symptoms and feverishly tries to find possible treatments, but she dies soon afterwards. Grief-stricken, Armstrong applies for Project Gemini and is accepted to NASA Astronaut Group 2. Armstrong, his wife Janet, and their son Rick move to Houston alongside other astronaut families. Armstrong befriends Elliot See, another civilian test pilot, and Ed White. As Armstrong begins training, Deke Slayton impresses upon the new astronauts the importance of the Gemini program, as the Soviet Union had reached every milestone in the Space Race ahead of the United States. Armstrong and Janet have a second son, Mark. By 1965, the family has settled in Houston, and Armstrong awaits selection for a crew. After the Soviets complete the first extravehicular activity (EVA), Armstrong is informed that he will be the commander of Gemini 8, with David Scott as the pilot.. During the fiercely competitive Space Race with the Soviet Union, Deke Slayton, the chief of the NASA astronaut office, hand-picks Neil Armstrong, an unassuming civilian test pilot in the aftermath of a crushing family tragedy, to join the ambitious Project Gemini. However, it took eight gruelling years filled with trials, failures, and innovations until Armstrong, serving as the commander of Apollo 11, finally landed the Apollo Lunar Module, Eagle, on the Moon's surface on July 20, 1969, along with fellow astronaut, Buzz Aldrin. And on the desolate, regolith-dusted lunar terrain, Armstrong made history by becoming the first human to set foot on the unexplored celestial body, located some 384,400 kilometres away from Earth.—Nick Riganas A semi-fictional account of the life of Neil Armstrong during his time in the NASA space program throughout the 1960s from 1961 just before being accepted into the Gemini program to the historic Apollo 11 flight to the moon - he the first human ever to step foot on its surface - in 1969 is presented, this presentation largely a character study. This profile is set against the backdrop of the space race between the Americans and Soviets, with the Soviets having beaten the Americans at every step along the way, hence the American push to be first on the moon arguably taking more risks than they may have otherwise to achieve that goal. Armstrong's stoicism is front and center in most situations, he largely displaying little emotion unless by himself, which also means not to his family including his wife, Janet Armstrong. The path to being chosen flight commander for Apollo 11 is shown to have been one of fortunate and unfortunate circumstances both for him and his colleagues, for him where some perceived he making missteps could have just as easily derailed his career.—Huggo",7.3,"$60,000,000 (estimated)","Ryan Gosling,Claire Foy,Jason Clarke,Kyle Chandler,Corey Stoll,Patrick Fugit,Christopher Abbott,Ciarán Hinds,Olivia Hamilton,Pablo Schreiber,Shea Whigham,Lukas Haas,Ethan Embry,Brian d'Arcy James,Cory Michael Smith,Kris Rey,Gavin Warren,Luke Winters,Connor Blodgett,Lucy Stafford,JD Evermore,Leon Bridges,Steve Coulter,Skyler Bible,William Gregory Lee,Choppy Guillotte,Braydyn Nash Helms,Edmund Grant,Callie Brown,Claire Smith,Brady Smith,John David Whalen,Matthew Glave,Rodney J.

Sixteen-year-old Ruby, one of the most powerful young people anyone has encountered, escapes her camp and joins a group of runaway teens seeking safe haven.

Director Chris Weitz's historical thriller is based on the story of how a group of Israeli secret agents arrested notorious SS officer Adolf Eichmann - the man who masterminded the ""Final Solution"" - in Argentina. Oscar Isaac plays the legendary Mossad agent Peter Malkin, while Ben Kingsley plays his emotionally manipulative arch-nemesis. After tracking Eichmann down to Buenos Aires, Malkin and his men captured him and brought him to Israel for a historic 8-month trial. On Christmas Eve in 1944, SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann (Kingsley) flees the Eastern Front to Berlin to coordinate the destruction of documents related to Department B4, going into hiding after the war ends. In Buenos Aires, Sylvia Hermann (Haley Lu Richardson) begins courting Klaus Eichmann (Joe Alwyn). Klaus meets Sylvia and her German-Jewish father, Lothar (Peter Strauss) at home. Klaus speaks of his father's service with the SS but tells Lothar that he had died on the Eastern Front, and that he has been raised by his uncle, Ricardo. Suspicious, Lothar passes this information to West German prosecutor-general Fritz Bauer. Bauer, suspecting Klaus' uncle may in fact be Adolf Eichmann, relays this intelligence to Mossad director Isser Harel (Lior Raz) in Tel Aviv, but Harel is unwilling to devote resources to investigate. At the insistence of Rafi Eitan (Nick Kroll), Harel dispatches field agent Zvi Aharoni (Michael Aronov) to Buenos Aries to begin reconnaissance. At a dinner party celebrating Argentina's 150th anniversary of independence from Spain, Klaus introduces Sylvia to Carlos Fuldner, a former Nazi officer who assisted with SS members escape to Argentina.

Peppermint,2018,"Five years after her husband and daughter are killed in a senseless act of violence, a woman comes back from self-imposed exile to seek revenge against those responsible and the system that let them go free. An unidentified woman is engaged in a brutal fight with a man in a car and finally dispatches him with a shot to the head. Five years earlier, the same woman, Riley North, is working as a bank teller in Los Angeles struggling to make ends meet. Her husband Chris owns a failing mechanic shop. They have a ten-year-old daughter, Carly. Chris' friend tries to talk him into robbing Diego Garcia, a powerful drug lord. Chris turns him down, but not before Garcia has already discovered his involvement and ordered his men to make an example of him. Riley and Chris take Carly out for pizza and to a carnival for her birthday since no one showed up to her party. At the carnival, Carly orders peppermint ice cream. As the family walks to the car, Diego's men gun down her husband and daughter in a drive-by shooting. She is wounded, but survives. Five long years earlier, the former Los Angeles bank teller, Riley North, was a doting mother of one, living a hand-to-mouth existence with her husband, Chris, and their ten-year-old daughter, Carly. Then, Chris, after toying with the dangerous idea of upgrading their lives, caught the eye of the pitiless local drug lord, Diego Garcia, and his murderous henchmen, who decided to make an example of him.

While Leo has stayed in Toronto working part-time at his father's pizzeria with the secret hopes of one day opening his own pizzeria, Nikki, who loved Leo while they were growing up, ran off to London five years ago hoping never to return to Toronto to get away from her past, which includes Leo himself, who she believes has turned into a ladies man solely trying to put notches in his bedpost, and Sal and Vince now in a feud of an unspecified nature following they winning best pizza in Little Italy several years ago, each subsequently having opened competing pizzerias next door to each other, which would preclude Nikki and Leo getting together even if either wanted.

The Old Man & the Gun,2018,"Based on the true story of Forrest Tucker and his audacious escape from San Quentin at the age of 70 to an unprecedented string of heists that confounded authorities and enchanted the public. Based on the true story of Forrest Tucker (Robert Redford), from his audacious escape from San Quentin at the age of 70 to an unprecedented string of heists that confounded authorities and enchanted the public. Wrapped up in the pursuit are detective John Hunt (Casey Affleck), who becomes captivated with Forrest's commitment to his craft, and a woman (Sissy Spacek), who loves him in spite of his chosen profession.—Fox Searchlight Pictures Crime, mostly robberies, is the only life Forrest Tucker has ever known. He is happy in this life and can't imagine doing anything else. Although he carries a gun when he commits his crimes, those crimes are of a non-violent nature on his part and always carried out with a smile on his face to reflect his true mood. That life has resulted in him being incarcerated several times leading to sixteen successful escapes from one correctional facility or prison after another. It's 1981, and Forrest, now seventy-four years old, has teamed up with similarly aged Teddy Green and John Waller to hold-up banks across the US south, Forrest the front man, Waller the lookout man, and Teddy the getaway driver. Outwardly, the hold-ups are unsophisticated, but they work largely on the premise that the bank tellers and managers with who Forrest deals will only remember him as being an unknown, harmless, friendly old man to who they in turn want to see no harm come, the robberies not even making the evening news. As such, no law enforcement officer will piece together the fact that a crime spree is actually happening. In the course of solely trying to evade the police after one of those hold-ups, Forrest meets widowed Jewel. He is eventually up front with her about what he does, and their friendship/burgeoning romance leads to Forrest, for the first time in a long time, wanting to take care of someone other than himself. She may thus factor into how he sees his long term life of crime. Meanwhile, Police Detective John Hunt has skated through his professional life without much effort or reward. He hitting the milestone of his fortieth birthday and learning after the fact that he and his adolescent son were actually in one of the banks when it was being held up leads to John wanting to make a name for himself, if only for himself and his family. So it becomes his mission after he does piece together that three old men have been robbing banks to apprehend them, whoever they are and however harmless Forrest may seem.—Huggo He may not look it; however, Forrest Tucker is a lifelong criminal, an expert escape artist, and a master bank robber. Without a doubt, his impeccable sense of fashion, his unwavering belief to never resort to violence, being polite, and robbing just enough money, always with a big smile on his lips, are the key components of Tucker's infallible strategy. Then, after a successful robbery, Forrest has a chance encounter with Jewel, a lady in distress, and they form an innocent relationship.

198,2. Green Book,2018,"A working-class Italian-American bouncer becomes the driver for an African-American classical pianist on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South. In 1962, tough bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga searches for work while his nightclub is closed for renovations. The most promising offer turns out to be the driver for African-American classical pianist Don Shirley for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a Black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin their trek armed with ""The Negro Motorist Green Book,"" a guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation. The snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America's appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other's talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they nurture an understanding and a friendship that would change both their lives.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) New York City bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga is searching for new employment after his nightclub is closed for renovations, eventually landing an interview as a driver for ""Doc"" Don Shirley, a famed pianist. Their first encounter does not go well, as Tony's flippant, uncultured behavior clashes with Don's sophisticated, reserved demeanor. However, Don eventually hires Tony on the strength of others' word, as he needs someone to help him stay out of trouble during an eight-week concert tour through the Deep South. They embark with plans to return home on Christmas Eve. Don's recording studio gives Tony a copy of the ""Green Book"": a guide for Black travelers to find safe havens throughout the segregated South. As they begin the tour in the Midwest, then head further south, Tony and Don clash over their differences; Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act properly, while Don is disgusted by Tony's habits. Regardless, Tony finds himself impressed with Don's talent on the piano--and increasingly disgusted by the discriminatory treatment the latter receives from the hosts when he is not on stage. After a bar incident leads to a group of white men threatening Don's life, Tony rescues him by threatening to pull a gun on them. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour. Dr. Don Shirley is a world-class African-American pianist who is about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. In need of a driver and protection, Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx. Despite their differences, the two men soon develop an unexpected bond while confronting racism and danger in an era of segregation.—Jwelch5742 The Bronx, 1962. In a city divided by segregation, two men from opposite worlds, the elegant and distinguished African-American classical pianist Don Shirley and the tough Italian-American nightclub bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga, form an unlikely bond. Their story takes an unexpected turn when the Copacabana Club in New York City shuts down for renovation, and Don, accompanied by his newly hired chauffeur, sets out on an adventurous two-month concert tour in the racially divided Deep South. Armed with his talent, dignity, and a copy of The Negro Motorist Green Book, a guidebook for African-American travellers, Don chooses to take the challenging path for the sake of progress. But are Don's determination and resilience enough to break the barriers of racial discrimination, or will the journey's daunting challenges break his spirit?

235,14. Trautmann,2018,"The love story of a young English woman and a German PoW, who together overcome prejudice, public hostility and personal tragedy. The Keeper tells the extraordinary love story of a young Englishwoman and a German PoW who together overcome prejudice, public hostility, and personal tragedy. While visiting a PoW camp near Manchester at the end of WWII, Margaret Friar, daughter of the manager of the local football team, notices young German soldier Bert Trautmann. Her father is so taken by Bert's prowess as a goal-keeper that he gets him out of the camp to play for his local team. Margaret and Bert's love blossoms despite local hostility and the resentment of the German PoWs. In the meantime, Bert's heroics in goal are noticed by Manchester's City Football Club. Rather than going back to Germany like nearly all the other camp inmates, Bert marries Margaret and signs for Man City. His signing causes outrage to thousands of Man City fans, many of them Jewish. But Margaret wins support from an unexpected direction: Rabbi Altmann, a Man City supporter who fled the Nazis, who publishes an open letter opposing the campaign against Bert. Bert's path to acceptance begins and peaks at the 1956 FA Cup Final when he secures victory for Man City by playing on despite breaking his neck. Yet fate twists the knife for both Margaret and Bert. Alienated and alone, Margaret's and Bert's loyalty to each other will be put to the test once more. Heartbroken, Bert wants to give up. Equally heartbroken, Margaret insists that they move forward and that he keeps on playing. A love story, a tale of huge sporting talent, and something more than both, The Keeper (based on a true story) follows Bert Trautmann (David Kross), a German Prisoner of War whose exceptional skills on the soccer field get him noticed by a local football team. Impressed by Bert's prowess as a goal-keeper, the team manager gets him out of the camp to play for his team. Meanwhile, love blossoms between the manager's daughter Margaret and Bert despite local hostility. Bert's subsequent signing by Manchester City brings passionate protests from the people of a city that had been severely bombed in the war. However, against all odds he wins over even his harshest critics during the FA Cup Final in 1956. Inspired by the true story of Bert Trautmann (Kross, of The Reader), a German who during World War II served as an ardent member of the Hitler Youth and later of the Luftwaffe. Then after the war he played soccer in England, as a goalkeeper for Manchester City. His presence on the team, which hired him in 1949, inspired protests.

236,15. Nobody's Fool,2018,"A woman is released from prison and reunites with her sister. She soon discovers that her sister is in an online relationship with a man who may not be what he seems. Danica is a successful worker at a marketing firm, and has been in a relationship with ""Charlie"", a man she met online a year ago but has never seen in person. When she is sent to pick up her recently-paroled sister Tanya from prison, her mother tells her that Tanya must stay at her house. Tanya is amazed by Danica's apartment and discovers that Danica's ex-fiance Bailey left her for another woman. Tanya thinks Danica is being catfished since she's never seen Charlie. The next day, Tanya and Danica stop by the Brown Bean, a coffee shop next to Danica's work. Frank, the owner, who has a crush on Danica, insists that he will let Tanya work there. When Danica goes to pick up Tanya from work that night she accidentally walks into an AA meeting that is being held there and overhears that Frank used to abuse alcohol and spent seven years in jail. While they love each other as sisters, Danica and Tanya are polar opposites. Responsible Danica is a marketing executive earning six figures, and seems to be on the verge of moving into a corner office after her next successful campaign which she is working on with her best friend, Kalli. Her life is organized on lists, one such a checklist of qualities of her perfect man. She has this checklist much like her mother Lola did as Danica wants her love life to be a magical one just like her parents'. She thought her boyfriend of six years Bailey was the man, that is until he left her for another woman breaking their engagement after she bought a wedding dress she still holds onto. Now she believes her boyfriend of one year, Charlie, who she met online, is that perfect man, despite they never yet having met as he works as an executive on a oil rig, and beyond he having sent photographs, they not even having video chatted in the Internet connection aboard the rig being bad. Knowing about Charlie doesn't stop good-hearted Frank, the owner of the coffee shop next to her office from letting her know that he is interested in her. She, in turn, won't even acknowledge his interest in deference to Charlie. While not meeting many of the items on her checklist, Danica further dismisses Frank when she learns that while he has turned his life around, he is a recovering addict and ex-con originally from the wrong side of the tracks. Conversely, Tanya, who has been in and out of prison over her life, lives for the here and now, easily moving from one thing or person to the next, while defending those she loves if she believes they've been wronged, like she believes Bailey wronged Danica, to which Kalli can attest despite Danica putting up a façade of he breaking up with her being for the best. When Tanya is released from prison after her latest five year stint, Danica is forced to take her in. While Danica feels like she has to guide directionless Tanya to help her get on her feet, it may be Tanya who is more of a guiding force for Danica in seeing life in front of them as opposed to Danica's nose stuck in lists.—Huggo",5.0,"$19,000,000 (estimated)","Tiffany Haddish,Tika Sumpter,Omari Hardwick,Mehcad Brooks,Amber Riley,Whoopi Goldberg,Missi Pyle,PJ Morton,Michael Blackson,Jon Rudnitsky,Chris Rock,Nev Schulman,Max Joseph,Adrian Conrad,Courtney Henggeler,Candace West,Crystal Lee Brown,Peyton Jackson,Al Hamacher,Victoria Ealy,Linda Boston,Nicole Sellars,Sylvia Robinson,John DeTarsio,Anderson Collins,Tyler Faison,Brian Cockerham,Edward Clark,Shemaiah Kedron Turner,Jakiya Ayanna Williams,Shaina A.

238,17. Stan & Ollie,2018,"Laurel and Hardy, the world's most famous comedy duo, attempt to reignite their film careers as they embark on what becomes their swan song: a grueling theatre tour of post-war Britain. The true story of Hollywood's greatest comedy double-act, Laurel and Hardy, is brought to the big screen for the first time. Starring Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly as the inimitable movie icons, 'Stan and Ollie' is the heartwarming story of what would become the pair's triumphant farewell tour. With their golden era long behind them, the pair embark on a variety hall tour of Britain and Ireland. Despite the pressures of a hectic schedule, and with the support of their wives Lucille (Shirley Henderson) and Ida (Nina Arianda)--a formidable double act in their own right--the pair's love of performing, as well as for each other, endures as they secure their place in the hearts of their adoring public. With their golden era long behind them, Laurel and Hardy embark on a variety hall tour of Britain. Despite the pressures of a hectic schedule, the pair's love of performing, as well as for each other, endures as they secure their place in the hearts of their adoring public.—Anonymous Both Steve Coogan as Stan Laurel and John C Reilly as Oliver Hardy give performances that bring back to life these two masters of Comedy. Coogan, not known as a serious actor, turns out a truly inspiring performance as Stan Laurel, portraying Stan as the more forceful member of the partnership and John C Reilly as Ollie, who is quite submissive, this is a complete reversal of the film portrayals of the duo, where Ollie is a 'know it all' and Stan is a dim wit. The film is a fictional story based on their 1953/1954 UK tour and what would ultimately be their last tour together, mainly due to Ollie's deteriorating health. The recreation of famous scenes from the original Hal Roach, Laurel and Hardy films, is remarkably accurate and a joy to watch. The 1953/53 Tour was very demanding on the duo and at times it seems that they were actually starting to dislike each other and that the tour would eventually fold and they would return to the US However things progressed from originally performing their show to half empty provincial theatres to performing at sold out large City theatres. They film recreates the duo performing scenes on stage from Laurel and Hardy's films, singing and dancing and of course slapstick. A good tribute of the biggest comedic film stars of the early years of talking pictures by two fine actors of the modern age.—bc1968",7.2,"$10,000,000 (estimated)","Steve Coogan,John C.

248,2. Instant Family,2018,"A couple find themselves in over their heads when they foster three children. Feeling a void in their marriage, Pete and Ellie Wanger visit a foster-care center. Two social workers, Karen and Sharon, guide the hopeful parents on the path to becoming adoptive parents.The couples are taken to a fair where they have the chance to go up to kids that they are interested in adopting. Pete and Ellie walk by the teenagers; although Ellie shows hesitance, one teen, Lizzy, informs Ellie that they all now that nobody wants to adopt teenagers. Pete and Ellie talk to Karen and Sharon over potentially taking in Lizzy. The social workers inform the couple that Lizzy's mother is a drug addict who is currently in jail, and she set their house on fire by leaving her crack pipe lit. They also find that Lizzy has two younger siblings, Juan and Lita. Although this seems like more of a challenge for Pete and Ellie, they agree to meet the siblings. Pete and Ellie have Thanksgiving dinner with Ellie's family, who all remark that they have no confidence that the Wagners would be good adoptive parents, until Ellie has enough and decides that they will go through with the foster care to prove that they can be good parents. Approaching middle age, Ellie and Pete Wagner, who flip houses for a living, have never felt it was time to have children--until now. For various reasons including their ages, they contemplate adopting an older child, taking that idea one step further by considering adopting a child in the foster care system for what they believe are altruistic reasons, but in reality is probably more to make themselves feel better by doing something they consider a social good, Pete equating it somewhat to taking in a rescue dog. Thus, they are probably not fully prepared for all it entails. Going through the foster-care training under social workers Karen and Sharon with other couples and singles, they, in meeting a number of foster children at a fair, decide on the spur of the moment to take their adoption idea two steps further, first by thinking of adopting a teenager in meeting feisty 15-year-old Lizzy, and second by adopting more than one child when they discover that Lizzy has two younger siblings, adolescent Juan and preschooler Lita. Beyond the racial issue of the children coming from a Hispanic background and the challenges of dealing with a teenager who already has a developed mind of her own, largely in acting as mother to Juan and Lita in the absence of their own incarcerated mother, they discover that adopting Juan and Lita have their own issues in each having their own but different emotional problems. Aside from the views of their respective families who see what they're doing very differently, Ellie and Paul must not only deal with three children at different stages of their lives and directly with the outward issues each brings into their lives, but with the hidden issues, including Lizzy's manipulations, with motivations that don't always match her outward actions.—Huggo",7.3,"$48,000,000 (estimated)","Mark Wahlberg,Rose Byrne,Isabela Merced,Gustavo Escobar,Julianna Gamiz,Octavia Spencer,Tig Notaro,Tom Segura,Allyn Rachel,Britt Rentschler,Jody Thompson,Margo Martindale,Julie Hagerty,Michael O'Keefe,Joan Cusack,Gary Weeks,Joy Jacobson,Andrea Anders,Kenneth Israel,Hampton Fluker,Randy Havens,Iliza Shlesinger,Javier Ronceros,Rosemary Dominguez,Eve Harlow,Joselin Reyes,Connor Jones,Jaiden Byrd,James Arthur Sims,Sarah Kirkpatrick,John McConnell,Maureen Brennan,Kelly Tippens,Charlie McDermott,Erika Bierman,Layla Felder,Candi Marie,Carson Holmes,Nicholas Logan,Allen Zwolle,Anthony 'Ace' Thomas,Andrene Ward-Hammond,Stella Doyle,Valente Rodriguez,Denitra Isler,Alexis Lord,Perry Westberry,Remy Ortiz,Mark Schotz,Jerry T.

256,10. On the Basis of Sex,2018,"The true story of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, her struggles for equal rights, and the early cases of a historic career that lead to her nomination and confirmation as U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice. Docudrama focusing on two periods of the young adult life of future US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The first time period is the late 1950s in her stint as a student at Harvard Law School, her class only the sixth after women were admitted to the school and including only nine females. Dean Erwin Griswold makes known in veiled terms to those nine that he would prefer if it was still an all male institution. As such, Ruth knows that she has to work twice as hard as any male student to make herself known, which is made all the more difficult with unexpected issues at home with her fellow Harvard Law School student husband, Martin D. Ginsburg. The second time period is in the early 1970s. Despite wanting to get a job as a trial lawyer at a law firm, no such firm would hire her solely because she is a woman, and despite she finishing at the top of her class. Instead, she is teaching law at Rutgers specializing in sex discrimination in the law, this chosen specialization arguably as she has faced inherent sex discrimination in her chosen career and that she wants to inspire future generations of women to achieve what she has been unable to do herself because of that discrimination. Things change when Marty, now an esteemed tax lawyer, brings to her a case that he feels could change the face of her work, a tax case in which, solely because of the law, there is reverse discrimination, namely against a male, the two who decide to work on the case together, he from the tax side, she from the sex discrimination side. She is eventually able to convince her old friend Mel Wulf at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to provide the organization's official support. Ruth and Marty are told in no uncertain terms that in the strong possibility that they lose, the result could irrevocably set their careers back. Winning is made all the more difficult in they having to work within the structure that supports that sex discrimination as ""that's the way it's always been done"", and as Ruth has no trial experience, she who can come across as a bitter woman who the world has wronged.—Huggo",7.1,"$20,000,000 (estimated)","Felicity Jones,Armie Hammer,Justin Theroux,Sam Waterston,Kathy Bates,Cailee Spaeny,Jack Reynor,Stephen Root,Chris Mulkey,Gary Werntz,Francis X.

258,12. The Grinch,2018,"A grumpy Grinch plots to ruin Christmas for the village of Whoville. For their eighth fully animated feature, Illumination and Universal Pictures present The Grinch, based on Dr. Seuss' beloved holiday classic. The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl's generous holiday spirit. Funny, heartwarming, and visually stunning, it's a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism. Academy Award nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company. With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Whoville when he runs out of food. Each year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter, and louder celebrations. When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas. To do so, he decides to pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh. Meanwhile, down in Whoville, Cindy-Lou Who (Cameron Seely), a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer, plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother. As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch's more nefarious one. Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus? Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos' holiday cheer once and for all?—Universal Pictures In the town of Whoville, human-like creatures called Whos are filled with excitement about celebrating Christmas. The only one who isn't amused is a cantankerous, green furred creature called The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch), who has a heart ""two sizes too small"" and lives in a cave on the top of Mount Crumpit just north of Whoville. The Grinch's only friend is his loyal pet dog Max and they both only visit Whoville when the Grinch needs to buy food and do bad things. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy-Lou Who (Cameron Seely) notices that her mother Donna (Rashida Jones) is overworked trying to take care of her and her twin infant brothers, Buster and Bean. She at first decides to send a letter to Santa Claus to help her mother but after encountering the Grinch, who sarcastically says that she'll have to talk to Santa face-to-face about it, she eventually decides to try and trap Santa with the help of her friends. It's a few days to Christmas and the small town of Whoville could not be more excited about the event. The townsfolk celebrate the occasion like nobody else. However, in a mountain cave high above the town lives someone who absolutely hates Christmas - The Grinch. This time he intends to ruin it for everybody.—grantss",6.4,"$75,000,000 (estimated)","Benedict Cumberbatch,Cameron Seely,Rashida Jones,Pharrell Williams,Tristan O'Hare,Kenan Thompson,Sam Lavagnino,Ramone Hamilton,Angela Lansbury,Scarlett Estevez,Michael Beattie,Lori Alan,Carlos Alazraqui,Doug Burch,Cathy Cavadini,Tucker Chandler,Townsend Coleman,Meilee Condron,Abby Craden,Brian T.

269,24. Hot Air,2018,"A right wing talk show host's life takes a sudden turn when his 16 year old niece comes crashing into his life. Slick comedy-drama from the director of The Wedding Singer, with Steve Coogan as an abrasive right-wing radio host whose perfect life is thrown into disarray when his sassy long lost 16-year old niece turns up on his doorstep, ready to challenge everything he stands for. Lionel Macomb is a New York City radio shock jock, his provocative right wing rhetoric which has led to cries that he is making the airwaves toxic, exactly what he wants partly to rile up his faithful angry listeners. His latest target is Senator Judith Montefiore-Salters and her Clean Slate initiative, which is to provide protections to offspring of illegal immigrants. In this era of philosophical wars between the right and left, he is losing listeners to upstart Gareth Whitley, a former protégé who has created his own radio show styled on old fashioned revivalist meetings and thus espouses traditional values, which Gareth arguably only uses as a counterpoint to Lionel and thus in a quest for increased ratings. While he lives a lavish lifestyle afforded by his success, Lionel comes by his views honestly, which is more than what he believes many others can say, in that his success is a result of his own hard work emerging from a difficult growing up in a broken home without any real adult guidance, something only that his inner circle knows. That inner circle includes his publicist and girlfriend Val Gannon, who stands by him despite his flaws, including infidelity, in her belief that she can reform him. Lionel's life is upended when his sixteen year old biracial niece, Tess Macomb, tracks him down, she the daughter of his estranged junkie sister Laurie Macomb, Tess who Lionel had no idea even existed and could not have cared less. Tess has managed to overcome her broken home life to emerge a bright young woman who has a full scholarship to prestigious Harper Academy, she needing a place to live while Laurie has checked herself into rehab, which she only did this time as a deal to Tess a condition of accepting the scholarship. Lionel does take her in largely to avoid any publicity not only about how he would have otherwise treated Tess, a minor, but of any news about his own childhood coming to light. Despite their philosophical differences, liberally-minded Tess and Lionel end up having a profound effect on each other's lives, with Val a moderating influence between the two.—Huggo",5.4,N/A,"Steve Coogan,Taylor Russell,Neve Campbell,Griffin Newman,Pico Alexander,Tina Benko,Lawrence Gilliard Jr.,Judith Light,Skylar Astin,John Rothman,Geoffrey Cantor,Jin Ha,Declan Michael Laird,Judah Friedlander,Michael Panes,Amy Holmes,Milda Gecaite,Teddy Coluca,Oona Roche,Tuffy Questell,Jared Sandler,Kevin Alexis Rivera,Yaron Urbas,Jamar Rogers,Lara Wolf,Jeanine Flynn,Paige King,Matthew Ballard,Dennis T.

274,4. Vice,2018,"The story of Dick Cheney, an unassuming bureaucratic Washington insider, who quietly wielded immense power as Vice President to George W. Bush, reshaping the country and the globe in ways that are still felt today. Governor George W. Bush of Texas, picks Dick Cheney, the CEO of Halliburton Company, to be his Republican running mate in the 2000 presidential election. No stranger to politics, Cheney's impressive resume includes stints as White House Chief of Staff, House Minority Whip, and Defense Secretary. When Bush wins by a narrow margin, Cheney begins to use his newfound power to help reshape the country and the world.—Jwelch5742 Dick Cheney, the 46th vice president of the United States, began his political career in the early 1960s as an intern during Richard Nixon's administration. After all, Lynne Cheney, his future wife, spurred Cheney's decision to take control of his life. He rose through the ranks of the White House when he joined the staff of his mentor, Donald Rumsfeld, who took him under his wing. But Cheney's political career was not without obstacles, as he lost his job during Jimmy Carter's presidency. However, he accepted George W. Bush's offer to be his running mate, a decision that would grant Cheney the power to influence foreign policy, particularly after the tragic and devastating terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.—Nick Riganas The political life of Dick Cheney, culminating with his Vice-Presidency in the George W. Bush administration from 2000 to 2008, is presented, that political life largely supported by his equally ambitious wife, Lynne Cheney. Their political ambitions were generally hindered by his less than charismatic demeanor which most politicians require to succeed. Those politics drifted into the right side of the spectrum rather than moving to the right by a deliberately ideological choice. But being elected the sole House Representative from their home state of Wyoming under the Republican banner led to ultimate thoughts of the top job in the White House. A number of factors kiboshed those thoughts, including how to protect his daughter Mary Cheney, who had just come out as lesbian, from public scrutiny while reconciling his support for her against the strong social conservative base of the Republican Party. The Cheneys' political fortunes changed when Dick, in the private sector as CEO of Halliburton, was asked by relatively-inexperienced George W. Bush to be his running mate. In this process, Dick began a manipulation of the system to his benefit where in his position of eventual VP he was able to be a more powerful politician working quietly and clandestinely behind the scenes than if he was actual president in the constant spotlight.—Huggo",7.2,"$60,000,000 (estimated)","Christian Bale,Amy Adams,Steve Carell,Sam Rockwell,Alison Pill,Eddie Marsan,Justin Kirk,LisaGay Hamilton,Jesse Plemons,Bill Camp,Don McManus,Lily Rabe,Shea Whigham,Stephen Adly Guirgis,Tyler Perry,Josh Latzer,Jeff Bosley,Camille James Harman,Jillian Armenante,Matthew Jacobs,Robert L.

Clint Eastwood stars as Earl Stone, a man who is ninety years old, broke, alone, and facing foreclosure of his business when he is offered a job that simply requires him to drive. Easy enough, but, unbeknownst to Earl, he's just signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel. He does well, so well, in fact, that his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler. But he isn't the only one keeping tabs on Earl. The mysterious new drug mule has also hit the radar of hard-charging D.E.A. Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper). And even as his money problems become a thing of the past, Earl's past mistakes start to weigh heavily on him, and it's uncertain if he'll have time to right those wrongs before law enforcement, or the cartel's enforcers, catch up to him. In Peoria, Illinois, Korean War veteran Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is a ninety-year-old horticulturist that has always prioritized his work and friends over his family. He is estranged by his ex-wife Mary (Dianne Wiest) and his daughter Iris (Alison Eastwood). When his granddaughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga) is celebrating her engagement with her fiancé, Earl is completely broke, and agrees to become a mule above any suspicion for the Mexican cartel, transporting drugs under the alias of ""Tata"". He makes money and resolves many financial issues of his family and friends. Meanwhile, efficient D.E.A. Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) is in charge of investigating the notorious cartel and the mysterious Tata with his partner Agent Treviño (Michael Peña).—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Due to financial problems, an 80-something-year-old man, Earl Stone, takes a job as a drug mule, driving shipments between Texas and Illinois for a Mexican cartel.

So a vague family friend's offer to earn a pack of banknotes by transporting a closed bag from Texas to Illinois in his trusted rickety truck and home is irresistible, so becomes his lucrative job, and he starts spreading the proceeds to family and veteran buddies.

Struggle: The Life and Lost Art of Szukalski,2018,"This documentary chronicles the life of Polish-American artist Stanislav Szukalski (1893-1987) from his early years in Chicago, to his time in Poland and Los Angeles, and his artistic and political contributions to the world. In old Betamax footage, the Polish-American artist Stanislav Szukalski (1893-1987) speaks animatedly about his life and work. Art aficionado Glenn Bray filmed his elderly friend in the last years of his life to document his remarkable career and personality before it was too late. In this wide-ranging portrait, Bray explains how he met Szukalski by chance in 1971 when he came across one of his expressionist drawings and discovered that its maker lived only a few miles away from him. The man leading a modest, anonymous life in Burbank, California turned out to have been a well-known avant-garde artist in Chicago and pre-war Poland. Szukalski created a mythology entirely of his own in his drawings and paintings, as well as an extensive manuscript. After his return to the United States, a group of artists and art lovers gathered around Szukalski, among them George DiCaprio and his son Leonardo, who jointly produced this documentary. The interviews and archive footage tell the extraordinary life story of a man who seemed to have been born for great things, but who lost virtually all his artwork in the Second World War. His past also includes a dark chapter that the filmmakers didn't discover until their documentary was in production.—Film Street Poland",7.9,N/A,"Stanislav Szukalski,Glenn Bray,Robert Williams,Suzanne Williams,Gabriel Bartalos,Sandy Decker,George DiCaprio,Natalia Fabia,Jose Ismael Fernandez,Rebecca Forstadt,Marek Hapon,Adam Jones,James Kagel,Lechoslaw Lemanski,Maciej Miezian,Karen Mortillaro,Piotr Rypson,Charles Schneider,Timothy Snyder,Jacek Staniszewski,Brian Tucker,Jim Woodring,Lena Zwalve",TV-MA,Ireneusz Dobrowolski,"Netflix,Netflix","Appian Way,Norah Films,Film Street,Rock Paper Scissors Entertainment,Makemake","Documentary,Biography",115

304,10. Late Night,2019,"A late night talk show host suspects that she may soon lose her long-running show. Katherine Newbury (Dame Emma Thompson) is a pioneer and legendary host on the late-night talk-show circuit. When she's accused of being a ""woman who hates women"", she puts affirmative action on the to-do list, and presto. Molly (Mindy Kaling) is hired as the one woman in Katherine's all-male writers' room. But Molly might be too little, too late, as the formidable Katherine also faces the reality of low ratings and a network that wants to replace her. Wanting to prove she's not merely a diversity hire who's disrupting the comfort of the brotherhood, Molly is determined to help Katherine revitalize her show and career--and possibly effect even bigger change at the same time. Comedy legend Katherine Newbury has been the queen of American late night talk television for twenty-eight years. In her quest for perfection, she has ruled over her show with an iron fist, she demanding commitment and loyalty, and will fire people for the slightest hint of not being up to that standard. She treats her staff largely as dispensable things rather than people in not even knowing most of her writing staff by name or face in not having met most of them. In an unexpected visit to the set by the current network president Caroline Morton, Katherine learns that the network is thinking about replacing her in they feeling that her shtick is stale as witnessed by declining ratings over the past decade, something about which she was totally oblivious in her narcissism. She believes the entire fault lies at the feet of her writers, who she decides to meet for the first time. They include the most recent addition, Molly Patel, on this her first day. Molly is unaware that she was a diversity hire in Katherine being accused of being anti-female in her entire writing staff being white males, Katherine having directed head writer Brad to hire a woman. Molly, who had no writing or television experience, was the only applicant fitting the bill, with her being South Asian an extra benefit in killing two birds with one stone. Molly not only is thus a fish out of water but a black sheep in she trying to find her place in this, a crucial time for the show as the writers as a collective try to save the show and thus their jobs. This task will be difficult in Katherine resisting change, and the writers fearing going outside of the box that Katherine has built for them leading to an overall sense of complacency. Within this situation, Molly will discover some diversity in that sea of testosterone white, she butting heads with Tom Campbell, who likes to remind anyone who will listen that he writes the monologues and who, as a nepo hire years ago, wanted his own younger brother for Molly's job, while she makes a connection with Charlie Fain, an aspiring stand-up himself.—Huggo",6.5,"$4,000,000 (estimated)","Emma Thompson,Mindy Kaling,John Lithgow,Hugh Dancy,Reid Scott,Denis O'Hare,Max Casella,Paul Walter Hauser,John Early,Luke Slattery,Ike Barinholtz,Marc Kudisch,Amy Ryan,Megalyn Echikunwoke,Blake DeLong,Jia Patel,Bill Maher,Seth Meyers,Annaleigh Ashford,Halston Sage,David Neal Levin,Maria Dizzia,Paige Gilbert,Cleo Gray,Kerry Flanagan,Lucas Caleb Rooney,Rupak Ginn,Hank Lin,Jake Tapper,Sophie Zucker,Jadon Woodard,Monroe Martin III,Glo Tavarez,Sakina Jaffrey,Diane Dehn,Jordan Ashley Anne Demeusy,Nick Denning,Joe Exley,Faith Logan,Doris McCarthy,Gregory Mikell,Vin Scialla",R,Nisha Ganatra,"Amazon Studios,Amazon Prime Video,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,Selmer Media,ARP Sélection,Entertainment One,Entertainment One,Falcon,Twentieth Century Fox,Ascot Elite Entertainment Group,Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions (SPWA),Stage 6 Films,Netflix,Nova Cinema,Universal Pictures,Universal Pictures,TME Films,Nickelodeon Network","3 Arts Entertainment,30WEST,FilmNation Entertainment,Imperative Entertainment,Kaling International,Stage 6 Films","Comedy,Drama",102

318,24. Honey Boy,2019,"A young actor's stormy childhood and early adult years as he struggles to reconcile with his father and deal with his mental health. From a screenplay by Shia LaBeouf, based on his own experiences, award-winning filmmaker Alma Har'el brings to life a young actor's stormy childhood and early adult years as he struggles to reconcile with his father through cinema and dreams. Fictionalizing his childhood's ascent to stardom, and subsequent adult crash-landing into rehab and recovery, Har'el casts Noah Jupe and Lucas Hedges as Otis Lort, navigating different stages in a frenetic career. LaBeouf takes on the daring and therapeutic challenge of playing a version of his own father, an ex-rodeo clown and a felon. Artist and musician FKA Twigs makes her feature-film debut, playing neighbor and kindred spirit to the younger Otis in their garden-court motel home. Har'el's feature narrative debut is a one-of-a-kind collaboration between filmmaker and subject, exploring art as medicine and imagination as hope. Sent to court-ordered rehab after yet another encounter with the police while driving under the influence, Otis, a now-grown-up former child actor and rising movie star, is diagnosed with PTSD.

In her much-anticipated foray into the horror-thriller genre, Golden Globe and Emmy nominee Taylor Schilling stars in THE PRODIGY as Sarah, a mother whose young son Miles' disturbing behavior signals that an evil, possibly supernatural force has overtaken him. Fearing for her family's safety, Sarah must choose between her maternal instinct to love and protect Miles and a desperate need to investigate what or who is causing his dark turn. She is forced to look for answers in the past, taking the audience on a wild ride; one where the line between perception and reality becomes frighteningly blurry. More and more, John and Sarah's only child, Miles, is showing signs of genius-level intellect, and an emotional detachment. Alienated and incapable of socialising with kids his age, Sarah brings a now-eight-year-old Miles to the reincarnation expert, Dr Arthur Jacobson, who has a bizarre theory about the origin of the exceptional boy's problems. However, is there a logical explanation for Mile's violent attitude and his increasingly hostile behaviour?

324,5. Cold Pursuit,2019,"A grieving snowplow driver seeks out revenge against the drug dealers who killed his son. Quiet family man and hard-working snowplow driver Nels is the lifeblood of a glitzy resort town in the Rocky Mountains because he is the one who keeps the winter roads clear. He and his wife live in a comfortable cabin away from the tourists. The town has just awarded him ""Citizen of the Year,"" but Nels has to leave his quiet mountain life when his son is murdered by a powerful drug lord. As a man who has nothing to lose, he is stoked by a drive for vengeance. This unlikely hero uses his hunting skills and transforms from an ordinary man into a skilled killer as he sets out to dismantle the cartel. Nels' actions ignite a turf war between a manically unpredictable gangster known as Viking and a rival Ute gang boss. Justice is served in one final spectacular confrontation that will leave (almost) no one unscathed. Nels has just been honoured as citizen of the year for his hard work, keeping the roads snow free at an exclusive snow resort near Denver Colorado. When his son is murdered on the orders of a vicious Drug Lord nicknamed Viking, Nels takes vengeance on each of the men involved, moving up the chain of command with each killing. Viking makes the mistake of thinking the killings are the work of a rival Native American drug cartel and begins a war which ends in a finale of last man standing proportions. Extreme violence with more than a hint of dark comedy which doffs its hat to the Cohen Brothers in atmospheric style. Now that he's won ski resort Kehoe's prestigious ""Citizen of the Year"" award, the quiet family man and taciturn snowplough operator, Nels Coxman, is, officially, a pillar of the community. Then, his son Kyle ends up dead by a ruthless local drug cartel, triggering a radical transformation and a blood-soaked journey of retribution. One after another, the bodies keep piling up as Nels and his unforgiving sawed-off hunting rifle seek the ""Viking,"" the one behind the murder of his only son.

327,8. The Aftermath,2019,"Post World War II, a British colonel and his wife are assigned to live in Hamburg during the post-war reconstruction, but tensions arise with the German who previously owned the house. Set in postwar Germany in 1946, Rachael Morgan (Keira Knightley) arrives in the ruins of Hamburg in the bitter winter, to be reunited with her husband Lewis (Jason Clarke), a British colonel charged with rebuilding the shattered city. But as they set off for their new home, Rachael is stunned to discover that Lewis has made an unexpected decision: They will be sharing the grand house with its previous owners, a German widower (Alexander Skarsgård) and his troubled daughter. In this charged atmosphere, enmity and grief give way to passion and betrayal.—Fox Searchlight Pictures The film takes place in Germany after the Second World War. The country is going through a very difficult time: around devastation and famine. Lewis Morgan is a British military soldier appointed by the command as interim mayor of Hamburg. This person has to raise the city from scratch. He arrives here with his wife, with whom he settles in a luxurious mansion. A German architect also lives in it with his emotionally unstable daughter. This man is also working to rebuild the city.—Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) Hamburg, Germany, 1946. In the aftermath of WWII, Colonel Lewis Morgan moves into the requisitioned house of former German architect Stefan Lubert and his troubled teenage daughter Freda, tasked with overseeing the reconstruction of Allied-occupied Hamburg and helping the population recover. As the British officer reunites with his wife Rachel after a long separation, suddenly, living under the same roof with the original occupants of the lavish mansion ratchets up the tension, raising suspicion and antipathy. Now, fleeting glances add fuel to the fire, and sooner or later, forbidden passions and heartbreak will enter the equation. In this uneasy arrangement, is there any hope left for humanity?—Nick Riganas It's five months after the end of WWII. Rachael Morgan has just joined her husband, British Army Colonel Lewis Morgan, in Hamburg, where he has been assigned as part of the Allied post-war mission to rebuild the city and to stamp out any Nazi or Nazi-sympathetic insurrection that may have lingered from the war. They are to live in the requisitioned country manor house belonging to widowed Stephen Lubert, an architect by trade before the war, and his teen daughter Freda Lubert, that requisitioning including keeping on a handful of the manor staff. Lewis has allowed the Luberts to remain living in a small wing of the house rather than they moving to the camp in he knowing the strain such would place on the city and his work. Rachael detests everything about this situation in not speaking the language, and living in a bombed out city, but mostly sharing the house with Germans who she blames for the death of her and Lewis' preteen son Michael Morgan when their home in London was hit with a bomb during the war, and pretending to be happy with a still largely absent Lewis, there existing a strain in their marriage ever since Michael's death, exacerbated in she knowing of a purposeful action by Lewis immediately after. Both Stephen and Freda are also emotionally scarred in Stephen's wife too a casualty of the war, Freda who is at an age of needing guidance as she grows into womanhood, and in losing their home despite not having been a member of the Nazi Party. In both of their emotional need, Rachael and Stephen eventually fall into each other's arms to embark in a romantic relationship. Beyond what is happening around them with Lewis' job and the war still on-going for some, the question becomes whether the other is what each of Rachael and Stephen is truly looking for in their need.—Huggo",6.4,N/A,"Keira Knightley,Ned Wills,Pandora Colin,Jason Clarke,Anna Schimrigk,Jack Laskey,Fionn O'Shea,Kate Phillips,Martin Compston,Alexander Skarsgård,Mirco Kuball,Rosa Enskat,Frederick Preston,Flora Li Thiemann,Monika Foris Kvasnicková,Logan Hillier,Jannik Schümann,Jim High,Roman Vejdovec,Halka Tresnáková,Henry Pettigrew,Tom Bell,Joseph Arkley,Abigail Rice,Naomi Frederick,Ivan Shvedoff,Alexander Scheer,Pip Torrens,Claudia Vaseková",R,James Kent,"Twentieth Century Fox,Fox Searchlight Pictures,Warner Bros.

Through circumstances beyond their control Tyler (32), a small-time outlaw on the run, becomes Zak's unlikely coach and ally.

Nearly a decade after occupation by an extraterrestrial force, the lives of a Chicago neighborhood on both sides of the conflict are explored. In a working-class Chicago neighborhood occupied by an alien force for nine years, increased surveillance and the restriction of civil rights have given rise to an authoritarian system - and dissent among the populace.—yusufpiskin Chicago, 2027.

385,16. Breakthrough,2019,"When her 14-year-old son drowns in a lake, a faithful mother prays for him to come back from the brink of death and be healed. When he was 14, Smith drowned in Lake Saint Louis and was dead for nearly an hour. According to reports at the time, CPR was performed 27 minutes to no avail. Then the youth's mother, Joyce Smith, entered the room, praying loudly. Suddenly, there was a pulse. It's January 2015 in St. Charles, a suburb of St. Louis. Fourteen year old John Smith, of Guatemalan descent, was adopted by Caucasians Brian and Joyce Smith when John was an infant and they were on a mission in Latin America. John is at the stage of his life where he is acting out, placing barriers between himself and his parents. The only things John seems to care about are basketball having made the school team's first string - and even then he has a tendency to grandstand on the court to prove himself to Chad who he beat out for the position - hanging out with his friends, particularly his best friends Josh and Rieger, and girls, most of his thoughts toward Abby. While Brian tries to connect to John by being his buddy and talking about basketball, Joyce feels they still have to be his parents and not his friends. The church used to be Joyce's sanctuary, but even the physical building of the church and the spirituality she got from it she feels are slowly being taken away from her in she constantly butting heads with the new pastor, Jason Noble, who is trying to take the church in a progressive direction against Joyce's sensibilities. Things for the Smiths change when on Martin Luther King Day, John, Josh and Rieger, against warnings, are playing on frozen St. Louis Lake, they eventually falling through the ice into the water. While first responders are able to pull Josh and Rieger out without incident, John has fallen below the ice unconscious into the murky water below. Although firefighter Joe Marrow believes they are now dealing with a non-emergency recovery rather than an emergency rescue mission, fellow firefighter Tommy Shine is able to locate an unresponsive John. John having been in the water for fifteen minutes, CPR not having been administered until twenty minutes after the fall, and rushing him to the hospital with no pulse for forty five minutes, Dr. Kent Sutterer, the attending ER doctor who happens to be Abby's father, allows Joyce to say her goodbyes to John. It isn't until Joyce is by John's side praying for a miracle that John regains a pulse. Following, differing views emerge as to John's potential recovery and survival. Dr. Garrett, the specialist in drowning cases, can only provide his scientific opinion, which is probable death through the night, and if John does survive, he will have suffered massive and permanent neurological damage with his brain being deprived of oxygen for such a long period of time. Brian, while at the hospital, cannot get himself to see John as he can only take his faith so far before common sense as to what will happen kicks in. Joyce, who has had a need to control things around her most of her life, does so as much as she can in John's situation, while she truly does believe that a miracle can happen as she continues to look to God. Pastor Jason knows he has to bridge what gaps have emerged between him and Joyce for both their and John's sake. And Tommy, a non-religious man, knows that some higher power that day told him to stay in the water to look for John.—Huggo",6.3,"$14,000,000 (estimated)","Marcel Ruiz,Topher Grace,Sarah Constible,Dennis Haysbert,Nancy Sorel,Miriam Smith,Victor Zinck Jr.,Mike Colter,Chrissy Metz,Josh Lucas,Taylor Mosby,Ali Skovbye,Maddy Martin,Isaac Kragten,Nikolas Dukic,Jordan Kronis,Jemma Griffith,Danny Wattley,Saul Elias,Stephanie Czajkowski,Kerry Grace Tait,Kate Yacula,Annelise Pollmann,Logan Creran,Lisa Durupt,Phil Wickham,Sandy Fernandez,Rena Semenko,Blair De Pape,Derrick Gottfried,Lecrae,Stella Pruse,Robert Morgan,Rebecca Staab,Cory Wojcik,Jay Koensgen,Jeff Strome,Jason Wishnowski,Chuck Shamata,Will Woytowich,Ryan Ash,Veronica Ternopolski,Sam Trammell,Scott Johnson,Mel Marginet,Elena Anciro,Rebekah Grenkow,Stephanie Sy,Ernie Pitts,Beverly Ndukwu,Karl Thordarson,Alicia Johnston,Lauren Cochrane,Kristen Harris,Erik Athavale,Robin Ruel,Onalee Minuk,Callie Lane,Danielle Savage,Isla Gorton,Lois Brothers,Tristan Mackid,Maclean Fish,Geoff Banjavich,Travis Bryant,Scott Carnegie,Connor Chennells,Kevin P.

Though the self-interested code of the town's old guard has governed for years, our tale takes place as the tides are turning in Easter Cove. Mary Margaret Connolly, a beloved and integral town matriarch, has just passed away. In the wake of her death, her daughters, Mary Beth and Priscilla, face an uncertain future, haunted by bills and unpaid loans left behind. Priscilla tries to fill her mother's shoes by taking over the family fish shop while her younger sister Mary Beth refuses to accept the new responsibilities. The sisters find themselves at odds and Mary Beth stubbornly defends her dream of leaving town - even if it means abandoning Priscilla altogether. Meanwhile, across town, at a bed and breakfast-turned-brothel, established town elder and madame Enid Nora Devlin is up to business as usual, except for two huge problems: someone stole $50K in cash and one of her girls, Dee, has gone missing. With little else to do, she sends her muscle, an outsider named Gorski, in pursuit of the cash and Dee. After a series of chance wrong turns sets Gorski on a collision course with Mary Beth, she accidentally kills him and must turn to the only person she has left: her sister. Together, the Connolly sisters must cover up Mary Beth's mistake and figure out what to do with the mysterious bag of cash they found in his shack. When Dee's body washes up on shore, the town's remaining matriarchs - Doreen, Gail and Susie - snap into action. These three, along with Enid and Mary Margaret, have quietly maintained the code of conduct for decades, navigating the murky water of the town's dubious past. The matriarchs intervene and make it their business to decide Enid's fate - as well as the fate of the Connolly sisters.",6.4,N/A,"David Coffin,David Pridemore,Adam Wolf Mayerson,Mark S.

404,11. Yesterday,2019,"A struggling musician realizes he's the only person on Earth who can remember The Beatles after waking up in an alternate reality where they never existed. In Lowestoft UK, Jack Malik is a frustrated musician whose musical career is going nowhere despite the faith that his friend/manager Ellie Appleton has in him. However, on the night Jack decides to give up, the whole world is momentarily hit with a massive blackout during which Jack is hit by a bus. Upon regaining consciousness, Jack learns to his astonishment that he is apparently now the only one who knows the music of the Beatles. Realizing this improbable opportunity, Jack begins playing the music of one of the world's greatest rock bands, being forced to claim it as his own. It pays off quickly and Jack becomes a worldwide musical sensation. However, Jack finds himself drifting away from Ellie, only realizing his love for her when she has become intimidated by his success, which depends on a blatant plagiarization that no one could find out. Now, Jack must make a fundamental moral decision about his music to satisfy his conscience as he decides what he truly needs.—Kenneth Chisholm One day Jack was nobody. Everything was perfectly normal. Until on that one day, a global power outage occurred, affecting everything. The very next day, Jack discovers that he is the only one in the world who remembers The Beatles. Whilst trying to wrap his head around what is happening, Jack finds himself on a journey to figure out what happened on that one night, and to bring back joy and bring back the memory of the one band from yesterday. Struggling to make a name for himself as a singer/songwriter, instead, hopeless Jack Malik is treading water in his career, stuck forever in the coastal town of Lowestoft, UK. Indeed, despite the unconditional support of his manager and best friend since childhood, Ellie Appleton, Jack is going nowhere fast until a cosmic freak accident alters the space/time continuum. Now, as Jack wakes up to find he is the only person on Earth who can remember the hits of the inimitable English rock band, The Beatles, he decides to start playing their songs and passing them off as his own, catching the eye of the English singer, Ed Sheeran, and the American music agent, Debra Hammer. At last, a dream comes true; however, as Jack becomes an overnight sensation, catapulting himself to global stardom, he realises that love is a delicate thing. Can Jack summon up the strength to stop living a lie?—Nick Riganas Late twenty-something Jack Malik of Suffolk, England, gave up a path to being a schoolteacher to pursue a full-time career as a singer/songwriter, he supported by a close group of friends, most specifically fellow schoolteacher Ellie Appleton, who acts as his part-time manager and who he's known since childhood. Getting nowhere in that music career, which includes needing to work a part-time job he hates as a stock clerk at a big box retailer to pay the bills, Jack decides to give up the music career to return to teaching. Things change following being hit by a bus while out cycling during a momentary worldwide power outage, many authorities believing due to a solar flare. Recovering from his injuries, Jack slowly comes to the realization that many things he knew as reality are no more for whatever reason, the most important of those to him being that The Beatles and thus their music have never existed. Believing it a path back to that music career, Jack starts performing The Beatles songs passing them off as his own. While slow to get notice, Jack does eventually get the attention of music professionals, it the start of the road to stardom. As his fame begins, Jack has to decide what's important to him, his friendship with Ellie, each who can admit to only to oneself that there are stronger feelings more than just friends, which may be a casualty of that stardom. That fame, however, may be at risk if anyone else in the cosmos is aware of The Beatles and thus that he is a fraud.—Huggo",6.8,"$26,000,000 (estimated)","Himesh Patel,Lily James,Sophia Di Martino,Ellise Chappell,Meera Syal,Harry Michell,Vincent Franklin,Joel Fry,Michael Kiwanuka,Karma Sood,Gus Brown,Sanjeev Bhaskar,Karl Theobald,Alexander Arnold,Dominic Coleman,Ed Sheeran,Jane Seaborn,Nic Minns,Maryana Spivak,Justin Edwards,Kate McKinnon,Javone Prince,Camilla Rutherford,Sarah Lancashire,Rachael Elizabeth,Jimmy Gallagher,Jaimie Kollmer,Sophie Mensah,Helena Devereux,Julian Feria,Lamorne Morris,Craig Rowin,James Corden,Cristina Dohmen,Elizabeth Berrington,Clementine Webb,Diana Pauline,William McGeough,Díana Bermudez,Sunny Yeo,Charlie Hannah,Xav Clarke,Oliver Booker,Michele Stodart,Michael Jablonka,Steve Pringle,Lewis Wright,Alex Bonfanti,Ifeoluwa Ogunjobi,Camilla George,Hannah Mbuya,Richie Seivwright,Chilli-Rae McCormack,Lucie Arnoux,Jelly Cleaver,Daisy Chute,Sandra-Mae Luijkx,Nad Abdoolakhan,Neilesh Ambu,Stephen Amis,Manoj Anand,Tom Andrews,Jennifer Armour,David Aspinall,Rosie Aspinall,Kay Aujla,Mark Ivan Benfield,Lalit Bhusal,Gavin Bromley,Christopher David Burton,Robert Carlyle,Camille Chen,Oliver Coles,Neil Sid Copp,David Thomas Coulter,Louise Dickinson,Simon Edwards,Rosa Evans,Adam Gammage,Ian Gardner,John Hales,Jane Hamer,Josh Harp,Nicholas Page Hayman,Greg Hess,Sam Hoggarth,Aaron Hotfelder,Mark Hugh-Williams,Kyle Hughes,Kyle James,Robert Jarvis,Amrita Jazzmyn,Arun Kapur,David Lautman,Jack Linsdell,Ibrahim Majid,Lee Marriott,Jade Martin-Capewell,Obie Matthew,Bharat Mistri,Conor Neaves,Vincent J.

Based on real events, A Hidden Life is the story of an unsung hero, Bl. Franz Jägerstätter, who refused to fight for the Nazis in World War II. When the Austrian peasant farmer is faced with the threat of execution for treason, it is his unwavering faith and his love for his wife, Fani, and children that keeps his spirit alive.—Anonymous WWII. Hard-working husband and wife farmers Franz and Fani Jägerstätter, parents to three infant daughters, are part of the tight-knit rural community, which includes extended family members, of St. Radegund nestled in the Austrian Alps. Along with his colleagues, Franz was sent home from basic training early in the conflict when it looked the war might be over with France's surrender to Germany. But in 1941 as the war continues, Franz is called back into military service. The problem now is that the Austrian military members must swear loyalty to Adolf Hitler, something that he in good conscience cannot or is unwilling to do. This stance places not only him but his family at greater odds with those in the community, each person objecting not always for the same reason, and thus leads to them being increasingly ostracized and isolated. With Fani by his side, Franz has to decide what to do, his continuing objections which they know could lead to him being imprisoned or possibly executed for treason. Beyond what he is to do, the further associated question becomes if there is a breaking point for him in the pressure placed by those around him and by the Nazis.—Huggo",7.4,N/A,"August Diehl,Valerie Pachner,Maria Simon,Karin Neuhäuser,Tobias Moretti,Ulrich Matthes,Matthias Schoenaerts,Franz Rogowski,Karl Markovics,Bruno Ganz,Michael Nyqvist,Wolfgang Michael,Johannes Krisch,Johan Leysen,Martin Wuttke,Waldemar Kobus,Sophie Rois,Alexander Fehling,Dimo Alexiev,Ida Mutschlechner,Maria Weger,Aennie Lade,Mark Waschke,Felix Römer,Andro Sarishvili,Levan Khurtsia,Max Malatesta,Ermin Sijamija,Markus Schwärzer,Ulrich Brandhoff,Michael Steinocher,Leo Baumgartner,Maria Stadler,Oliver Pezzi,Alexander Radszun,Thomas Mraz,Dieter Kosslick,Bernd Hölscher,Christian Sengewald,Johannes Nussbaum,Leonard Kunz,Moritz Katzmair,Amber Shave,Barabara Stampfl,Johannes Gabl,Katja Lechthaler,Max Mauff,Monika Lennartz,Horst Saller,Joel Basman,Keenan Bassma,Sarah Born,Mathias Datow,Walter de Winter,Dominik Hermanns,Adolf Hitler,Konrad Hochgruber,Jasmin Barbara Mairhofer,Thomas Nash,Robin Oberhollenzer,Ingrid Porzner,Thomas Prenn,Jürgen Prochnow,Nicholas Reinke,Peter Schorn,Florian Schwienbacher,Benno Steinegger,Chris Theisinger",PG-13,Terrence Malick,"Fox Searchlight Pictures,UGC Distribution,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Blitz,Imperial / Cinepix,Odeon,SF Film Finland,SF Film,SF Norge A/S,SF Studios,Times Media Films,Twentieth Century Fox,United King Films,Walt Disney Company,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Argentina,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,White Nights,20th Century Fox Home Entertainment,20th Century Fox Home Entertainment,Alive Vertrieb und Marketing,HBO Max,NOS Audiovisuais,Disney+,Disney+,7flix,Pandora Film Verleih,Pandora Film Verleih,Pandora Film Verleih","Fox Searchlight Pictures,TSG Entertainment,Elizabeth Bay Productions,Aceway Productions,Mister Smith Entertainment,Studio Babelsberg,Orange Studio,Alto Adige Productions","Biography,Drama,Romance,War",174

As the welcoming community's peculiar traditions blemish the folkloric utopia, an uncomfortable undercurrent of uneasiness creeps up on the unsuspecting guests.

468,1. Ford v Ferrari,2019,"American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. In the mid-1960s, Enzo Ferrari's fast Rosso-Corsa racing cars were dominating the motorsport world. Meanwhile, Carroll Shelby, an American car designer, had retired after winning the demanding 1959 '24 Hours of Le Mans' endurance race. However, an unexpected proposition from Lee Iacocca, the Vice President of Henry Ford II's motor company, presented an opportunity to beat the Italians at their own game. Under these pressing circumstances, Ken Miles, a British sports car driver and racing engineer, reluctantly agreed to help improve the Americans' image. But Ford's race team had less than ninety days to rewrite history. As a result, the non-conformist duo came up with the Ford GT40 Mk I, a powerful, high-performance racing car. Nevertheless, the question remained. Can Shelby and Miles break Ferrari's long winning streak?—Nick Riganas American automotive designer Carroll Shelby and British race car driver Ken Miles compete in a fierce corporate battle as well as nature itself, to build a vehicle for the Ford automobiles. Together, they plan to compete against the race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966.—Jwelch5742 Ford Company has a big problem in selling its cars in the 1960s. They decide to take part in 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race to show and advertise their cars. Ferrari's fast racing cars dominate the mid-60s racing world. Ford's advertisement team request Carrol Shelby to build fast cars for the race. Shelby asks British driver and racing engineer, Ken Miles to be the main driver for Ford's company in the race. Dramatizes a specific item from automotive history. It's the early 1960s, and the iconic American company, Ford Motors, is facing some difficult times. Vice president Lee Iacocca believes they have to make the company sexier to the American consumer by setting up a race car division, akin to Ferrari, which has reigned supreme at the ultimate automobile race, the twenty-hour hour race at Le Mans. President Henry Ford II makes an offer to buy for sale Ferrari, the offer which Enzo Ferrari only uses to make a more lucrative deal with Fiat, in the process Ferrari also denigrating what he considers overbloated Ford. As such, Ford spares no expense for his own race car division, he hiring Le Mans winner turned sports car designer and manufacturer Carroll Shelby as the engineering head of that race car division. Ford's ultimate goal is to beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby knows that money alone cannot produce success, and that equally as important is racing inherent in the company's culture. As such, he hires as part of his design team Ken Miles, whose life is racing which he has built into his supportive family of wife Mollie and their adolescent son Peter. Shelby finds that his ultimate opponent is not Ferrari but rather the corporate mentality at Ford, especially of Ford himself and who Ford appoints as head of the race car division, Leo Beebe, who in particular doesn't see bohemian Miles as ""Ford material"". Making the situation more difficult is that Shelby believes, in he knowing the machine, that Miles is the best person as driver.—Huggo",8.1,"$97,600,000 (estimated)","Matt Damon,Christian Bale,Jon Bernthal,Caitríona Balfe,Josh Lucas,Noah Jupe,Tracy Letts,Remo Girone,Ray McKinnon,JJ Feild,Jack McMullen,Corrado Invernizzi,Joe Williamson,Ian Harding,Christopher Darga,Shawn Law,Emil Beheshti,Darrin Prescott,Alex Gurney,Benjamin Rigby,Ben Collins,Francesco Bauco,Guido Cocomello,Adam Mayfield,Sean Carrigan,Lachlan Buchanan,Giles Matthey,Rudolf Martin,Evan Arnold,Darin Cooper,Elizabeth Dement,Wallace Langham,Jonathan LaPaglia,Brad Beyer,Ottavio Taddei,Giovanni Cirfiera,Wyatt Nash,Drew Rausch,Ward Horton,Luiggi Debiasse,Michael Lanahan,Tanner Foust,Peter Arpesella,Andrew Burlinson,Lou Beatty Jr.,Clément Larue,Olivier Blin,Marc Forget,Stephane Fiorenza,Joss Glennie-Smith,Tim Banning,Arron Shiver,Paul Fox,Zack Zublena,Aylam Orian,Kirt Kishita,Stefania Spampinato,Gian Franco Tordi,Cameron Hennings,James Tappan,Ryan O'Dell,Mario Di Donato,Bonnie Antonini,Jenelle McKee,Grace Fae,Jan Munroe,Marisa Petroro,Leif Carlgren,Jon Ueberroth,Camillo Faieta,Steven Ziel,Vernon Dew,Angelo Dibello,Larsen Deane,Craig Frosty Silva,Brad McCabe,Brent Pontin,Mark Krenik,Thomas John Rudolph,Emmeline Luka Bale,Kai Andersen,Evin Charles Anderson,Joshua Bankey,Brea Bee,Kyle Andrew Bell,Hugh Benjamin,Dylan James Boland,Daniel Bondor,Jason Breznikar,Michael Wayne Brown,Jeff Burhans,Sandy Burhans,Sergi Cervera,Alan Cevallos,Jorge Cevallos,Zachary Chicos,David Cohen,Carl Collanus,Morgan Combes,Corey Crandall,Savannah Cruz,Giulia Da Pian,Sarah Dale,Tomer David,Rick L.

It Chapter Two,2019,"Twenty-seven years after their first encounter with the terrifying Pennywise, the Losers Club have grown up and moved away, until a devastating phone call brings them back. Defeated by members of the Losers' Club, the evil clown Pennywise returns 27 years later to terrorize the town of Derry, Maine, once again. Now adults, the childhood friends have long since gone their separate ways. But when people start disappearing, Mike Hanlon calls the others home for one final stand. Damaged by scars from the past, the united Losers must conquer their deepest fears to destroy the shape-shifting Pennywise -- now more powerful than ever. Derry, Maine.

Since it's defeat in 1989, Pennywise has grown hungry, and is now back with a vengeance. If the losers club doesn't defeat him this time, their worst fear will become a reality, with nothing to stop him. The clock is ticking. Who's going to be scared first?

One last battle awaits Derry's remaining fighters of the supernatural.

493,1. Knives Out,2019,"When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From Harlan's disfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death.—Lionsgate Nothing could blemish the lavish birthday party at the palatial estate of acclaimed crime/mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey except for his strange and unaccountable death. Now, the sharp knife in the silver-haired deceased's hand is a dead giveaway that something, or someone, had been bothering Harlan. But cryptic detective Benoit Blanc is not entirely sure. Because, as it turns out, there are more than a few members of the successful author's clingy family who have been economical with the truth so far. And as Blanc struggles to shed light on a tangled mess of half-baked leads and little white lies, all eyes are on the grand prize: Harlan's magnificent legacy. The question is, can Benoit find the answer to this perplexing case before someone else dies?—Nick Riganas The morning after his eighty-fifth birthday party held at his Norfolk County mansion with his dysfunctional family of his mother, his surviving children, their spouses, and their children in attendance, successful novelist and publishing house owner Harlan Thrombey, self-made in his wealth, is discovered in his attic study by Fran, one of the housekeepers, him dead with his throat slashed, knife in hand. Arguably the last person to see him alive was his Brazilian nurse, Marta Cabrera, the daughter of an illegal immigrant, something she has told few within this sphere. She went through her evening ritual of playing a game of Go with him and administering his medication at that time. A week later following the funeral, the local police are questioning the family members at the mansion to see what happened that night that could have led to his death, the questioning in their belief that Harlan committed suicide. The interviewees all confirm the time-line of events supporting that suicide belief. One other person at each of the interviews is famed private detective Benoit Blanc, who the family will learn has been retained as a consultant. What he fails to tell them in return is that he was hired anonymously, cash in advance. Blanc is able to bait many of the interviewees into bad mouthing other family members while being reticent to admit something that Blanc already seems to know about them, each of the family members looking out solely for him/herself. The key interview, one that happens unexpectedly, may be with Marta, who Blanc suspects was Harlan's confidante and who cannot lie in always having the physical reaction of vomiting whenever she does. One person not interviewed in being absent is one of Harlan's grandchildren, overly privileged Ransom Drysdale, who left the party early after having had a private conversation with his grandfather, he not being interviewed somewhat immaterial as Ransom was known to have not been at the mansion at the time of death. The nature of the investigation changes a week later at the reading of the will, where all will discover but some who were already aware that Harlan had rewritten it the week before his death, the specific changes not known until this day. With all these comings and goings, learning the full truth of what happened with Harlan may come down to discovering the unknown of who hired Blanc and why.—Huggo",7.9,"$40,000,000 (estimated)","Daniel Craig,Chris Evans,Ana de Armas,Jamie Lee Curtis,Michael Shannon,Don Johnson,Toni Collette,LaKeith Stanfield,Christopher Plummer,Katherine Langford,Jaeden Martell,Riki Lindhome,Edi Patterson,Frank Oz,K Callan,Noah Segan,M.

Jojo Rabbit,2019,"A young German boy in the Hitler Youth, whose hero and imaginary friend is the country's dictator, is shocked to discover that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home. A World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism.—Fox Searchlight Pictures 1944 Germany. Ten year old Johannes Betzler, more commonly called Jojo, is the son of good Germans, his father away fighting in Italy, while he is under the care of his mother Rosie, with his older sister Inge recently having passed away from illness. With only one true friend in the form of same aged, bespectacled Yorki, Jojo, in wanting to fit in, is arguably entering what he would consider the most important phase of his young life in attending a Nazi youth camp presided over by Captain Klenzendorf, Captain K's almost too faithful assistant Freddy Finkel, and Fräulein Rahm, who takes Nazi policies in a slightly off-kilter direction. Despite being considered an outsider by most of the other youth in town, Jojo figures he has a leg up on everyone else at camp in that he is constantly being guided by the spirit of Der Führer himself, Adolf Hitler, whose personal bodyguard Jojo aspires to be when he grows up. In his general day-to-day life but also supported by his time at camp, Jojo has a hatred for Jewish people despite not really knowing anything about them or ever having met anyone of the Jewish faith, the ultimate goal to kill them. So when Jojo meets someone Jewish for the first time, especially as that meeting is in what is for him the most unlikely of circumstances, Jojo has to figure out what to do. While truly believing he is a Nazi despite not really knowing what that means, he has to decide either to follow what he has been taught in hating and trying to kill any Jewish person despite knowing that killing is not in his true nature, or not, which may have larger consequences with relation to family. While he decides, he truly gets to know the person beyond the label of ""Jewish"" which may factor into what happens.—Huggo In the ultimate days of the Third Reich, young Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler is eager to do his part by joining the Nazi Party's youth organisation. Instead, a disastrous first assignment earns the Führer's tiny number one fan an embarrassing nickname and gets the ambitious candidate kicked out. Now, Jojo has nothing but time on his hands. As the disillusioned boy grapples with a new reality after stumbling upon a shocking secret, he must question everything he's ever known. But fear and prejudice consume the world.

Secluded in his deceased father's horse ranch in Arizona, John--along with his teen niece, Gabrielle, and her grandmother, Maria--leads a serene life, until an urgent invitation drags the gullible seventeen-year-old girl to the squalid slums of Mexico, in search of a ghost. Now, even though he tried so hard to renounce his former violent self, once more, John is on the warpath, many painful decades after the bitter guerrilla warfare in First Blood (1982). Nearly all his life, John has been fighting a seemingly interminable war, seeking a place he could call home. But, what's the good of pursuing a beautiful dream when everyone you love has gone?—Nick Riganas He was once a killing machine in his youth. But he always had his own morals. The main character of the film 'Rambo: Last Blood' never abandoned his friends and comrades. For the sake of help, he was ready to look death in the eye. He single-handedly attacked entire armies and always won. He managed to do what others could not do. Because of this, even the most dangerous people on the planet feared and respected him.—Tango Papa",6.1,"$50,000,000 (estimated)","Sylvester Stallone,Paz Vega,Sergio Peris-Mencheta,Adriana Barraza,Yvette Monreal,Genie Kim,Joaquín Cosio,Pascacio López,Óscar Jaenada,Alexander Dimitrov,Aaron Cohen,Nick Wittman,Jessica Madsen,Louis Mandylor,Owen Davis,Jamieson Urquhart,Brayden Pindur,Fenessa Pineda,Marco de la O,Alvaro Flores,Úrsula Murayama,Cathy Pulido,Atanas Srebrev,Rick Zingale,Manuel Uriza,Georgi Manchev,Georgi Dimitrov,Mirka Prieto,David Aguirre Firth,Díana Bermudez,Cuco Usín,Lyubomir Neikov,Domenic Charles Vargas,Sergio Hernandez,Victor Baioco,Sheila Shah,Dimitri 'Vegas' Thivaios,Simona Zdravkova,Tanya Stefanova,Velichka Georgieva,Dobrinka Georgieva,Ashli Dolat,Gloria Georgieva,Melani Petrova,Nadejda Koleva,Simona Yanusheva,Jaklin,Melin Edrinch,Roza Georgieva,Madlen Kovacheva,Evelina Igova,Daniel Mora,Ricky del Castillo,Nelly Chunchukova,Carlos Licea,Daria Mitusheva,Ivan Rangelov",TV-MA,Adrian Grunberg,"Lionsgate,Lionsgate,Lionsgate,Multivision Multimedia India,Another World Entertainment,Ascot Elite Entertainment Group,BF Distribution,Blitz Film & Video Distribution,Bontonfilm,Bontonfilm,CGV Mars Dagitim,CJ CGV Viet Nam,California Filmes,Constantin Film,Deepjoy Picture,Dutch FilmWorks (DFW),Eagle Films,Future Film,Gaga,Golden Village Pictures,HKC Entertainment,Imagem Filmes,Joyncontents Group,Kinepolis Film Distribution (KFD),Kinomania,Meloman,Metropolitan Filmexport,Mis.

A powerful and thought-provoking true-story, ""Just Mercy"" follows young lawyer Bryan Stevenson (Jordan) and his history-making battle for justice. After graduating from Harvard, Bryan might have had his pick of lucrative jobs. Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemned, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley (Larson). One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in 1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite a preponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony against him came from a criminal with a motive to lie.

In a rush of panic, he steals 'The Goldfinch', a painting that eventually draws him into a world of crime. 13-year-old New Yorker Theo Decker's life is turned upside-down when his mother is killed in a terrorist attack at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Confused in the rubble of the tragedy, he steals a priceless piece of art known as The Goldfinch. There has been one defining event in early twenty-something Theo Decker's life, it which separates his life into before the event and after the event, and which has directly or indirectly shaped everything important since: a terrorist bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City when Theo was thirteen. Theo and his mother were in the museum at the time, she killed in the explosion while Theo was in a different part of the museum. Theo has blamed himself for her death in he being the reason for their unplanned trip there. With his alcoholic father out of the picture and his whereabouts unknown, Theo went to live temporarily with the upper middle class Barbour family, that of one of his few friends, Andy Barbour, until a more permanent situation could be arranged. Another item specifically tied to that day is that out of circumstance, Theo stole a famous painting, The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius, it since thought to having been destroyed in the explosion. Theo also comes to understand that there were others affected by the bombing, including the Blackwell family, antiques dealer and reburbisher Welty Blackwell also subsequently perishing from the explosion, while his young teen daughter, Pippa Blackwell, was, like Theo, emotionally traumatized and physically injured in the explosion. Theo not only befriends Pippa but also Welty's business partner in Blackwell + Hobart, James Hobart, familiarly referred to as Hobie, and Welty, just before his death, who asked Theo to return something to Hobie for him.

508,17. The Paranormal,2019,"A secluded farm is struck by a strange meteorite which has apocalyptic consequences for the family living there and possibly the world. A story of cosmic terror about The Gardners, a family who moves to a remote farmstead in rural New England to escape the hustle of the 21st century. They are busy adapting to their new life when a meteorite crashes into their front yard. The mysterious aerolite seems to melt into the earth, infecting both the land and the properties of space-time with a strange, otherworldly color. To their horror, the Gardner family discover that this alien force is gradually mutating every life form that it touches...including them. When an iridescent meteorite plummets from outer space and into the property and foundations of a remote New England estate, a malignant force begins to insidiously permeate the lives of an unassuming family. The effects are gradual - time begins to dilate, nature assumes an otherworldly hue - and all things bright and beautiful eventually mutate and corrupt under its influence. So proceeds this eerie adaptation of the short story by H.P. Lovecraft, one of horror's most haunting, here presented by the enigmatic South African filmmaker Richard Stanley. Returning to Midnight Madness 29 years after his hypnotic killer-robot fandango Hardware first premiered in the section, Stanley summons his uniquely hallucinogenic sensibilities to envelope his endearing characters in surreal, incremental dread. At first, their domestic bliss is quietly fraught with an undercurrent of unnerving tension, before eventually boiling over into delirious, acid-fueled terror. The patriarch of this doomed brood is none other than Nicolas Cage, continuing his recent renaissance as a midnight-movie staple with an increasingly unhinged performance that reliably ricochets among every technique in the Stanislavski playbook. The rest of the ensemble, which includes Joely Richardson and Tommy Chong, play effective foils to Cage's delirium, but the real star of the show is the alien entity itself. This all-consuming, dispassionate menace manifests itself in a series of grotesque, body-horror, and psychedelic spectacles, worthy of its ineffable literary origins.—Toronto International Film Festival After a meteorite lands in the front yard of their farm, Nathan Gardner (Nicolas Cage) and his family find themselves battling a mutant extraterrestrial organism as it infects their minds and bodies, transforming their quiet rural life into a technicolor nightmare.—RLJE Films In the lands west to Arkham (New England) lives the Gardner family: father Nathan, mother Theresa, older brother Benny, middle sister Lavinia and little child Jack. Fulfilling the first year of the moving to Nathan's family house from the city and six months of Theresa's mastectomy to heal her cancer, Lavinia feels her life struck trapped in the middle of nowhere. Fan lover of Wiccan witchcraft, the same day that she makes a ritual hoping back to the city she meets Ward Phillips, a young hydrologist sent to test the healthiness of the water in the zone. This night, a meteorite falls close to the house, causing a great shock and illuminating everything with a strange color. Looking for help, Nathan calls Mayor Tooma and Sheriff Pierce with unsuccessful results, but Ward appears and interests about it, accepting Nathan's advice to meet Ezra, the old hippie who lives close to them. However, the Gardner's family life turns soon in a nightmare: Nathan's body start to be infected by the arms and absent-minded Theresa cuts herself two fingers while she was cutting carrots to dinner. While Nathan takes Theresa to the hospital, the other three feel the corrupt influence of the meteorite: Jack obsesses with ""the man in the well"" that he hears all the time, Benny experiments memory losses by time dilation and Lavinia feels her own body ill. At the same time, animals and plants in the vicinity mutate by the contact bathed with the color. But when Nathan and Theresa return from the hospital, horror takes over Gardners: a wave of color hit Jack and Theresa to transform them in an unspeakable being. While Ward tries to save Gardners and specially Lavinia, situation gets out-of-control by a deranged Nathan.

510,19. Saint Maud,2019,"A pious nurse becomes dangerously obsessed with saving the soul of her dying patient. There but for the grace of God goes Maud, a reclusive young nurse whose impressionable demeanor causes her to pursue a pious path of Christian devotion after an obscure trauma. Now charged with the hospice care of Amanda, a retired dancer ravaged by cancer, Maud's fervent faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her ward's soul from eternal damnation - whatever the cost. Making her feature-film debut, writer/director Rose Glass cannily lures the audience into this disturbed psyche, steadily setting up her veritable diary of a country nurse for an unnerving and ultimately shocking trajectory. Morfydd Clark (also at the Festival in The Personal History of David Copperfield) portrays the sanctimonious Maud with an intense stoicism that belies a disquieting vulnerability, as Maud desperately vies for absolution and solidarity from her embittered patient (an enthralling Jennifer Ehle, also at the Festival in Beneath the Blue Suburban Skies). Glass tenderly captures this relationship with an empathetic gaze that first assumes an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere--but before long, Maud's dogmatic candor incites an irreconcilable friction that spirals her mind into a suffocating confluence of creeping doubt and paranoia. As Glass tightens the screws on her misguided martyr, well-placed nods are made to religious horror forerunners like William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist,"" further contributing to the film's increasingly dread-filled malaise. And when this insidious fever climatically breaks, the consequences are devastating and terrifying in equal measure.—Toronto International Film Festival Deeply-religious Maud, a tight-lipped live-in nurse with a dark past, takes a job in a humdrum English coastal town to look after Amanda Köhl, a once-celebrated, now terminally-ill former dancer and choreographer. Convinced that she has been sent to sensualist, chain-smoking Amanda with a purpose, ascetic Maud soon becomes obsessed with saving her vulnerable patient from herself, and in the process, lead her to the light. However, is worldly Amanda prepared to receive absolution for her sins?—Nick Riganas In Coney Island, England, the nurse Katie quits her job and has a breakdown after losing a patient in the hospital where she works. She changes her name to Maud, converts to the Catholic church and works in a private agency providing nursing care to the needy. She is assigned caretaker of the former dance and choreographer Amanda Köhl, who is terminal with lymphoma. The pious Maud believes she can save the soul of the atheist Amanda and likes to pray with her. One night, Maud meets Carol and discovers that she has sex with Amanda.

However, does Danny dare return to Room 237?—Nick Riganas Dan Torrance became an alcoholic and restless drifter all over the US since surviving a boyhood trauma, on top of an abusive drunk father, as intended victim of the True Knot, Rose the Hat's band of evil 'vampiric' nomads, who survive barely aging by absorbing the 'steam' (life force) of kids they abduct and torture to death or occasionally enlist, like sadistic siren Lucy Stone. Dan finds a new home in a New Hampshire town, where Samaritan Billy Freeman introduces him to an AA community and becomes his neighbor by paying the grumpy landlady an advance, even arranges a fitting job at the local hospice, where Dan's remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying, which a prescient cat indicates. The blackboard in his room also enables him to be contacted mentally by evanescent Abra Stone, an exceptionally strong telepath, able to ward off Rose psychosomatically, but therefore indicated as greatest-ever prize to her searcher Crow Daddy. Dan Billy and Abra team up to search the True Knott and strike first, which proves harder and bloodier than either expected, with a frosty final fight in a Colorado bunker.—KGF Vissers Dan Torrance has tried to run away from his past, namely the fact of his supernatural ability to ""shine"", in combination with the associated events at the Overlook Hotel the winter when he was five, when his parents took on the winter caretaker jobs at the otherwise closed hotel and the evil supernatural powers at the hotel which overtook his father, Jack, who almost killed him and his mother, Wendy, that winter. Dan has turned to alcohol to cope. It isn't until he moves to Frazier, New Hampshire, befriends Billy Curtis, who sees in him the signs of being an alcoholic, and gets a job as an orderly at a hospice where he can use his ability to shine to comfort patients that he finally feels at peace with himself. It is then when he is contacted by someone through her own ability to shine, she, a tween named Abra Stone in nearby Anniston, New Hampshire and feeling in Dan a kindred spirit, who eventually warns him against evil powers, True Knot, led by Rose the Hat, who are looking for others who shine to kill them to feed off their energy for greater power and supposed immortality. Dan has to decide what to do with this information, he who may want to live in his newfound peace, but who may not be able to run away from Rose and True Knot regardless, especially in they looking for the most powerful, he and his new friend Abra among those.—Huggo",7.3,"$45,000,000 (estimated)","Ewan McGregor,Rebecca Ferguson,Kyliegh Curran,Cliff Curtis,Zahn McClarnon,Emily Alyn Lind,Selena Anduze,Robert Longstreet,Carel Struycken,Katie Parker,Jamie Flanagan,Met Clark,Zackary Momoh,Jocelin Donahue,Dakota Hickman,Carl Lumbly,Henry Thomas,Bruce Greenwood,Sallye Hooks,Alexandra Essoe,Roger Dale Floyd,George Mengert,Jacob Tremblay,Chelsea Talmadge,Violet McGraw,Bethany Anne Lind,Nicholas Pryor,Peggy Tillman,Deadra Moore,Jason Davis,Alyssa Gonzalez,Shane Brady,Danny Lloyd,Michael Monks,Hugh Maguire,Sadie Heim,Kk Heim,Mistie Gibby,Callie McClincy,Logan Medina,Johnnie Gordon,Molly C.

When the sheriff arrives, things deteriorate badly prompting Fanny to make drastic decisions about her life. Set on an isolated farm in Shropshire in 1657. The story of Fanny Lye, a woman who learns to transcend her oppressive marriage and discover a new world of possibility - albeit at great personal cost. Living a life of Puritan stricture with husband John and young son Arthur, Fanny Lye's world is shaken to its core by the unexpected arrival of two strangers in need, a young couple closely pursued by a ruthless sheriff and his deputy. On an isolated English farm in 1657, Fanny (Peake) lives a quiet life with her oppressive husband John (Dance) and their young son. One day their life is rocked with the arrival of young couple Thomas (Fox) and Rebecca (Reynolds) who claim to have been robbed and need a place to stay. But are these strangers really who they say they are? England, 1657: the time of Oliver Cromwell's civil and religious wars. The married couple John and Fanny Lye, devout Puritans, live on a remote farm in Shropshire when a naked young couple suddenly breaks into their home. The uninvited guests turn out to be ""Ranter"" - members of a small pantheistic religious group that particularly rejects the concept of sin - and are on the run from a sheriff who has caused a bloodbath among their brothers and sisters in faith. Against John's resistance, Fanny insists on tending to the wounds of the two strangers and offering them protection. However, Thomas and Rebecca quickly shake up the peace in the house, as their religious views and their free and cheerful interaction arouse the displeasure of the master of the house. Fanny, on the other hand, feels that something may be missing from her life so far. The battle for religious sovereignty quickly turns into a brutal struggle for Fanny's body and soul, all the more so when the sheriff is able to follow the trail of the fugitives back to the Lyes' farm.—Arte",6.2,N/A,"Maxine Peake,Charles Dance,Freddie Fox,Tanya Reynolds,Zak Adams,Peter McDonald,Perry Fitzpatrick,Kenneth Collard",N/A,Thomas Clay,"ARTE,ARTE,Alamode Film,Coproduction Office,Encripta,Quiver Distribution","Pull Back Camera Ltd.,Essential Filmproduktion GmbH,British Film Institute (BFI),Creative England,Film- und Medienstiftung NRW,Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg,ZDF/Arte,011 Productions,Film i Väst,Filmgate Films,Metrol Technology","Drama,History,Thriller",112

545,4. Last Christmas,2019,"Kate is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Working as an elf in a year-round Christmas store is not good for the wannabe singer. However, she meets Tom there. Her life takes a new turn--that seems too good to be true. It's the Christmas season 2017 in London. Ever since recovering from a serious health issue which could have easily taken her life, that health issue which culminated on Christmas day last year, Kate, whose family emigrated from the former Yugoslavia in escaping the Balkan wars, is a changed person, and not for the better. Now irresponsible and self-absorbed, she is running out of friends' couches on which to sleep in they coming to final straws with her, this couch surfing which she still finds preferable to going home to her parents', especially in not wanting to deal with her tactless and overbearing mother. Working as a salesclerk at Yuletide, a year 'round Christmas store which is entering its busiest time of year, she is continually close to hitting final straws with her boss as well, a Chinese woman who has assumed the name Santa for the business and who only keeps Kate on in remembering back to the time when she was an asset to the business. Kate now aspires to a life as a performer in musical theater, she working under the misguided belief that her chutzpah alone will get her work. Within this situation, Kate meets Tom, who she believes is coming on to her, she putting him off in he not being her type. But persisting, he ends up showing Kate another side of London and another side of life. But as Kate begins to have feelings for him and sees him as an important emotional support for her, he, whose intentions he admits are not romantic, begins to be harder and harder to find, all she knowing about him being that he volunteers in the night shift at a homeless shelter. In the two having some sort of bond, the question then becomes if they will ever come into sync together, factoring into the equation the reason for Tom's persistence with her in the first place.—Huggo",6.5,,"Madison Ingoldsby,Emma Thompson,Boris Isakovic,Lucy Miller,Emilia Clarke,Maxim Baldry,Margaret Clunie,John-Luke Roberts,Michelle Yeoh,Bilal Zafar,Patti LuPone,Lydia Leonard,Henry Golding,Michael Addo,Peter Mygind,Rob Delaney,Peter Serafinowicz,Sara Powell,Ranjit Singh Shubh,Ritu Arya,Ansu Kabia,Fabien Frankel,Laura Evelyn,Ingrid Oliver,Rebecca Root,Angus Brown,Kemi Durosinmi,Yinka Awoni,Angela Wynter,Sue Perkins,Ben Owen-Jones,David Hargreaves,Joe Blakemore,Calvin Demba,Leon Delroy Williams,Anna Calder-Marshall,Jassie Mortimer,Michael Matovski,Jake Lampert,Jade Anouka,David Mumeni,Laila Alj,Liran Nathan,Amit Shah,Shahzad Ali,Shelly Allen,Christopher Amos,Rodrig Andrisan,Claire Ashton,Maria Barr,Emily Barton,Pierre Bergman,Ruth Clarson,Kimberly Collison,Ben Conlon,Rene Costa,David Cradduck,Richard Curtis,Ramzy El Huraiby,Errol Francis,George Glasgow,Mark Gooden,Kelsey Greaves,John Heartstone,Harry Holland,Van Hu,Pippa Hurley,Emma Jonnz,Joelle Koissi,Nina Kumar,Adnan Kundi,Xiao Xue Xu Lin,Ning Lu,Prince Marfo,Daniel Maya,Martyn Mayger,Zara McDowell,Bharat Mistri,Niamh O'Mahony,Barbara Orti,Jacqueline Ramnarine,Andrew Ridgeley,Mario Romano,Susanne Schraps,Robert Soar,Peter Stanford,Karol Steele,Sanj Surati,Richard Sutar,Peter Trevor,Michael van Koetsveld,Greg Wise,Michael Yates,Joanna Zwierzynska",PG-13,Paul Feig,"Universal Pictures,Universal Pictures International (UPI),NOS Audiovisuais,Tulip Entertainment,United International Pictures (UIP),United International Pictures (UIP),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Universal Pictures International (UPI),Parco Co.

But this time, what should have been a simple swindle escalates into a cat-and-mouse game with the ultimate stakes. Career con artist Roy Courtnay (Sir Ian McKellen) can hardly believe his luck when he meets well-to-do widow Betty McLeish (Dame Helen Mirren) on-line.

What Betty is unaware of however in cherishing Roy as a companion she so desperately needs is that Roy is a high stakes con artist, who, at least according to his regular partner in crime Vincent, does it as much for the thrill as for the money. He is also not averse to using violence, including kill, to maintain his cover. While the stakes of his cons are high, Roy has to continue to do it to survive as he usually has to share those high stakes among several accomplices. Eventually, Roy begins to believe that he's hit the jackpot in Betty in learning that her net worth is close to £3 million, of which he would only have to share a small portion with Vincent. In gaining Betty's confidence, Roy believes he has one thing going against him and one thing going for him. The former is Betty's suspicious grandson, graduate student Stephen, who is writing his dissertation on Albert Speer and who seems to be looking out for his grandmother in not trusting Roy on any little thing. And the latter is learning that Betty has health issues, which will take her earlier from the world than later.

572,6. Bombshell,2019,"A group of women take on Fox News head Roger Ailes and the toxic atmosphere he presided over at the network. When Gretchen Carlson slaps Fox News founder Roger Ailes with a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, not a soul could predict what would happen next. Her decision leads to Fox News correspondent Megyn Kelly coming forward with her own story, as well as multiple other women, inciting a movement that reverberates around the world.—Jwelch5742 Against the backdrop of the 2016 United States presidential election, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly found herself embroiled in controversy after questioning Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, on his misogynistic comments. And then, on July 6, 2016, something started to change. After all, Gretchen Carlson, the network's former anchorwoman, had already set in motion a maelstrom of events for refusing to exchange sexual favours with Fox News mogul Roger Ailes. As a result, other journalists, such as the ambitious producer Kayla Pospisil, came forward. United, three wronged women bent on bringing down the powerful CEO were prepared to reveal the toxic world of sexual harassment in a workplace environment. However, were Megyn, Gretchen, and Kayla the only ones who didn't get along with the boys?—Nick Riganas Focusing on three women - two real life and one fictitious (arguably a composite of many real life women) - the toxic work environment at Fox News for females at the hands of the network's President Roger Ailes is dramatized, specifically the period in early to mid 2016. Megyn Kelly has made it to where many aspire, namely hosting her own prime time show on the network, as well as being given the plum assignments, such as being one of the moderators of the GOP's presidential candidates debate. Unlike most right wing journalists, she decides to confront candidate Donald Trump about his poor public treatment of women, especially the denigrating name calling, such action by Kelly which does not sit well with the staunchest of his supporters. Gretchen Carlson was once at Kelly's position with the network, but she is seeing her star fading given a dead on-air time slot, that demotion largely from her outspoken stance on many issues. She, in the process, receives Ailes' ire in not presenting herself as eye candy as is the unofficial expectation of all women at the network, on air personalities or otherwise. Seeing the writing on the wall, she takes preemptive steps to protect her future. Kayla Pospisil, an avowed evangelical, has always wanted to work for Fox, and aspires to being an on-air personality. In taking proactive steps to reach that goal, she attracts the attention of Ailes. A major incident occurs at the network in that Carlson is ultimately fired, which prompts her to enact those steps she was working on: she sues Ailes himself for sexual misconduct, unlike previous suits by others before her suing the network unsuccessfully. Factoring the fear that exists among many female employees that are aware of Ailes' actions toward them as a collective, Kelly and Pospisil have to decide if they will come forward publicly to divulge their own experiences of Ailes' inappropriate behavior toward them - Kelly's ten years prior, Pospisil's current - at the possible risk to their careers where Ailes and the network have not tolerated anything but unconditional loyalty.—Huggo",6.8,"$32,000,000 (estimated)","Charlize Theron,Nicole Kidman,Margot Robbie,John Lithgow,Allison Janney,Malcolm McDowell,Kate McKinnon,Connie Britton,Liv Hewson,Jack Haven,Rob Delaney,Mark Duplass,Stephen Root,Robin Weigert,Amy Landecker,Mark Moses,Nazanin Boniadi,Ben Lawson,Josh Lawson,Alanna Ubach,Andy Buckley,Brooke Smith,Bree Condon,D'Arcy Carden,London Fuller,Sedona Fuller,Kevin Dorff,Richard Kind,Michael Buie,Marc Evan Jackson,Anne Ramsay,Jennifer Morrison,Ashley Greene,Ahna O'Reilly,Lisa Canning,Elisabeth Röhm,Alice Eve,Rachael Drummond,Katie Aselton,P.J.
