""Some things are beyond repair."" The In Between (2022) by writer, Marc Klein, is a supernatural Love Story about an aspiring photographer, ""Tessa"" (Joey King) desperately trying to make contact with ""Skylar"" (Kyle Allen), the boyfriend who died in a car accident (and seems to be trying to get her attention). Via poignant time-line clips, the story follows the grief-stricken Tessa on a backwards journey of reflection from waking up in the hospital (after the accident) to replaying memories of their sweet summer romance. Throughout all this, Skylar's persistent and obvious attempts to let Tessa know he's near, gradually succeed in crossing the line between heaven and earth and into a desperate embrace with the woman he loves and misses. It's a little scary and intense, but this is the moment Tessa has been hoping for. She and Skylar are once again together-Tessa being in a coma--and she must now choose between life on earth and spending eternity with Skylar. What we also see in this heartfelt and suspenseful romance is a masterful execution of romance-film conventions that pull us into the intimate bonding stages of this believable and budding relationship, while subtly tugging at our own emotions and beliefs of the afterlife. It's clever how Tessa's photography-which she never thinks is good enough for others to see--is cleverly woven as both the film's romantic motif as well as Tessa's other passion for living. And though the ending may seem predictable, the narrative has enough emotional twists and turns to make you guess otherwise.—T.B.

52,3. Everything Everywhere All at Once,2022,"A middle-aged Chinese immigrant is swept up into an insane adventure in which she alone can save existence by exploring other universes and connecting with the lives she could have led. With her laundromat teetering on the brink of failure and her marriage to wimpy husband Waymond on the rocks, overworked Evelyn Wang struggles to cope with everything, including a tattered relationship with her judgmental father and daughter. And as if facing a gloomy midlife crisis wasn't enough, Evelyn must brace herself up for an unpleasant meeting with an impersonal bureaucrat: Deirdre, the shabbily dressed IRS auditor. However, as the stern agent loses patience, an inexplicable multiverse rift becomes an eye-opening exploration of parallel realities. Will Evelyn jump down the rabbit hole? But how many stars are in the universe? Can weary Evelyn fathom the irrepressible force of possibilities, tap into newfound powers, and prevent an evil entity from destroying the thin, countless layers of the unseen world?—Nick Riganas Evelyn Wang is going through the motions of life in trying to achieve some sort of fulfillment, which she may or may not admit to herself has, so far, been unsuccessful at almost any level. She and her husband, Waymond Wang, own and operate a laundromat, and while she loved him when they were first married - marrying him against the advice of her judgmental father's - she now feels that he is a weak man whose messes she has to fix. On the flip side, she has no idea that he has had papers drawn for divorce, or that he only plans on going through with it as a last resort if things between them don't improve. She feels she has never really had the love or respect of her father - whom she ran away from as a young adult - and now he has come from Asia to the US to live with her and Waymond. Evelyn and Waymond's only offspring, young adult Joy Wang, has turned into a version of her by pulling away, not feeling any love or getting any respect, and as such, being aimless in life. What may be the pinnacle of the mother/daughter problems is that Joy has not only brought her girlfriend Becky into their lives - how to explain Becky to her father and others like him; the biggest issue in the same sex vein - but Becky is also white. Conversely, Evelyn's life could have been so much more if she made different choices or followed through with any of the many other things she started. On top of preparing for a Chinese New Year's Eve party under the pressure of trying to meet the exacting standards of her father, she and Waymond are also in the middle of an IRS audit by their auditor, hard-nosed Deirdre Beaubeirdre. As Evelyn and Waymond enter into what is supposed to be their final ""show me the proper paperwork or else"" meeting with Deirdre, Evelyn physically and metaphysically enters into alternate universes, where she not only has to make the right choices to save the collective universe, but arguably more importantly, come to a true understanding of herself.—Huggo Evelyn Wang and her husband, Waymond, run a laundromat. Times are tough, and they're in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. There's also some fuss with their daughter, and Evelyn's father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. And now, Waymond wants a divorce. Could things have turned out differently for Evelyn--maybe in a parallel universe?—grantss A middle-aged Chinese laundromat owner must get in touch with her other selves who are scattered across the multiverse. This woman is the key to saving reality itself, but she can't do it alone; her family's fate is intertwined with the fate of the multiverse too.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187",7.8,"$14,300,000 (estimated)","Michelle Yeoh,Stephanie Hsu,Ke Huy Quan,James Hong,Jamie Lee Curtis,Tallie Medel,Jenny Slate,Harry Shum Jr.,Biff Wiff,Sunita Mani,Aaron Lazar,Brian Le,Andy Le,Narayana Cabral,Chelsey Goldsmith,Craig Henningsen,Anthony Molinari,Dan Brown,Panuvat Anthony Nanakornpanom,Cara Marie Chooljian,Randall Archer,Efka Kvaraciejus,Peter Banifaz,Audrey Wasilewski,Li Jing,Dylan Henry Lau,Peter Boon Koh,Timothy Eulich,Daniel Scheinert,Michiko Nishiwaki,Jane Lui,Jason Hamer,Timothy Ralston,Hiroshi Yada,Elle Alexander,Emmett Ferguson,Seth Fuentes,Waymond Lee,Amanda MacLeod,Randy Newman,Craig Ng,Pablo Ramos,D.Y.

54,5. The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,2022,"Moviestar Nick Cage is channeling his iconic characters as he's caught between a superfan and a CIA agent. The fictionalized version of Nick Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous super fan Javi Gutierrez. Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Nick Cage is recruited by a CIA operative Vivian and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Unfortunately, Hollywood mega-star Nicolas Cage, is with his back to the wall. Drowning in debt after an ugly divorce, Nick is willing to try everything to get his career back on track, including appearing at a one-off, ludicrously well-paid event for Spanish olive-oil magnate and number one Nicolas Cage fan Javi Gutierrez in sunny Mallorca. Instead, undercover CIA agents, an abduction right under everyone's nose, and an unwanted, peril-laden mission spell trouble for everyone involved, dragging Cage into a frantic adventure. And just like the movies, the guns have the final say. Can a lifetime of experience in killer one-liners and exciting climactic endings save the guy from The Croods: A New Age (2020)?—Nick Riganas Nicolas Cage is totally preoccupied with his career, his narcissism fueled by insecurity in being constantly pestered by the manifestation of his ego, ""Nicky"", in his failures. Those failures are currently real in no longer getting the film roles he wants, and that obsession negatively affecting his relationships with his ex-wife Olivia but more importantly his sixteen year old daughter Addy. Solely as an excuse to address that professional flailing, he decides to quit acting. But still needing to pay the bills, especially in light of the divorce, he accepts a lucrative private appearance in Mallorca at super-fan Javi Gutierrez's birthday party, Nic unaware that Javi is an aspiring screenwriter who wants him to star in his penned movie. Nic's arrival at Javi's catches the attention of CIA agents Vivian and Martin, who are investigating the politically motivated kidnapping of a young woman named Maria Delgado. This confluence of events places Nic in arguably the greatest acting role of his life, but one that is real life with implications of his life and that of his loved ones at risk.

Sonic and his new friend Tails is all that stands in their way. Sonic is back with a boom, this is by far the most entertaining of all video game adaptions in history. It was great to see Jim Carrey reprise his role of Dr Robotnik, he plays the role so well the first time and this time he does it even better.

A great family film for all the kids to love and those like me who grew up playing Sonic on the dreamcast/Nintendo, these past couple of years have activated alot of nostalgia among the art of film.

When an injured player from the A-team is selected to play with the Bs as part of his recovery, tensions are already high. Initial suspicion turns to physical lust for two of the team members and personal loyalties are stretched as they try to conceal the affair, not only from their own partners but also their teammates.

Hard drinking and macho antics are par for the course amongst the team, but these bulky athletes soon reveal their vulnerabilities.

In From The Side dives deep into rugby-half macho battlefield, half tender brotherhood-but don't sweat the rules (or ""laws,"" which even the sport's fans find impenetrable): the real drama occurs off the field as infidelities, heartbreak, and unimpeded passions rule the day.

106,7. Elvis,2022,"The life of American music icon Elvis Presley, from his childhood to becoming a rock and movie star in the 1950s while maintaining a complex relationship with his manager, Colonel Tom Parker. Elvis follows the story of infamous rock 'n' roll star Elvis Presley seen through the eyes of his controversial manager Colonel Tom Parker. The film explores Elvis Presley's highs and lows and the many challenges and controversies he received throughout his career.—VooDoo The film explores the life and music of Elvis Presley (Austin Butler), seen through the prism of his complicated relationship with his enigmatic manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks). The story delves into the complex dynamic between Presley and Parker spanning over 20 years, from Presley's rise to fame to his unprecedented stardom, against the backdrop of the evolving cultural landscape and loss of innocence in America. Central to that journey is one of the most significant and influential people in Elvis's life, Priscilla Presley (Olivia DeJonge). From his rise to fame to his unprecedented superstardom, rock 'n' roll icon Elvis Presley maintains a complicated relationship with his enigmatic manager, Colonel Tom Parker, over the course of 20 years. Central to Presley's journey and happiness is one of the most influential people in his life --—jepstein13 Almost half a century after his untimely death on August 16, 1977, in Memphis, Tennessee, the dysfunctional relationship between Elvis Presley, The King of Rock 'n' Roll, and his long-time manager Colonel Tom Parker continues to stir controversy. To clear his name and set the record straight about his involvement with Elvis's rise to fame and career, a dying, penniless Parker awakens alone in a Las Vegas hospital room in 1997, with his mind filled with memories. As the colonel reminisces about their eventful, two-decade-long love/hate relationship, elements of Elvis Presley's story--from the singer's humble roots, Parker's first encounter with Presley in 1955, the influence of black music, country, gospel, and blues--unfold. On his deathbed, Tom Parker looks back on other pivotal landmarks of their career path, including Elvis's military service in West Germany, his focus on a new movie career, and the performer's marriage to Priscilla Presley. Of course, the former manager calls to mind Elvis Presley's return to live performances with the 1968 televised Christmas concert, Elvis: The Comeback Special (1968), the 5-year residency in the International Hotel, Las Vegas, and the last Nebraska concert on June 20, 1977, at the Pershing Municipal Auditorium, Lincoln.

Dr Alithea Binnie (Tilda Swinton) is an academic - content with life and a creature of reason. While in Istanbul attending a conference, she happens to encounter a Djinn (Idris Elba) who offers her three wishes in exchange for his freedom. This presents two problems. First, she doubts that he is real and second, because she is a scholar of story and mythology, she knows all the cautionary tales of wishes gone wrong. The Djinn pleads his case by telling her fantastical stories of his past. Eventually she is beguiled and makes a wish that surprises them both. In her quest to find the common truths behind humankind's stories, British narratologist Dr Alithea Binnie finds herself in Istanbul. When Alithea stumbles upon an intriguing, hand-blown crystal bottle, the curious academic unleashes the supernatural force living in the peculiar glass container: the Djinn, or the Genie in the bottle. As the otherworldly entity enthrals Alithea with extraordinary stories spanning three millennia, the shocked professor has three wishes to fulfil her heart's desires.

111,12. Crimes of the Future,2022,"Humans adapt to a synthetic environment, with new transformations and mutations. With his partner Caprice, Saul Tenser, celebrity performance artist, publicly showcases the metamorphosis of his organs in avant-garde performances. It sounds just as ambitious, taking a deep dive into the not-so-distant future in which humankind is learning to adapt to its synthetic surroundings. This evolution moves humans beyond their natural state and into a metamorphosis, which alters their biological makeup. While some embrace the limitless potential of trans-humanism, others attempt to police it. Either way, Accelerated Evolution Syndrome, is spreading fast. Saul Tenser is a beloved performance artist who has embraced this new state, sprouting new and unexpected organs in his body. Along with his partner Caprice, Tenser has turned the removal of these organs into a spectacle for his loyal followers to marvel at in real time theater. But with both the government and a strange subculture taking note, Tenser is forced to consider what would be his most shocking performance of all.—Deadline As the human species adapts to a synthetic environment, the body undergoes new transformations and mutations. With his partner Caprice, Saul Tenser, celebrity performance artist, publicly showcases the metamorphosis of his organs in avant-garde performances. Timlin, an investigator from the National Organ Registry, obsessively tracks their movements, which is when a mysterious group is revealed... Their mission - to use Saul's notoriety to shed light on the next phase of human evolution.—Neon In a not-so-distant future, humankind is learning to adapt to its synthetic surroundings. Their biological makeup changed, many humans have adapted to life with ""Accelerated Evolution Syndrome"" thanks partly to specialized equipment that aids in everything from eating to sleeping. Beloved performance artist Saul Tenser sleeps in a womb-like bed suspended in mid-air. The OrchidBed, as it's called, comes complete with software to anticipate, and adjust his every bodily need. The machine even detects the growth of new organs, which Saul's creative partner Caprice can observe and tattoo in his personal operating theatre. Together, Saul and Caprice have turned the discovery and removal of these new body organs into performance art, via sold-out voyeuristic surgical shows using a sarcophagus-like machine where the surgeries take place. These human evolutionary changes do not receive universal positivity. Before long, a new secret government entity is established - the National Organ Registry, led by bureaucrats Wippet and Timlin - to discreetly track new organ growths, with particular enthusiasm for Saul's artistic anomalies. With increased scrutiny on the syndrome and therefore his art, Saul is forced to consider what would be his most shocking performance of all.—Serendipity Point Films",5.8,"$35,000,000 (estimated)","Sotiris Siozos,Lihi Kornowski,Scott Speedman,Viggo Mortensen,Léa Seydoux,Don McKellar,Kristen Stewart,Nadia Litz,Tanaya Beatty,Mihalis Valasoglou,Welket Bungué,Tassos Karahalios,Ephie Kantza,Yorgos Pirpassopoulos,Jason Bitter,Denise Capezza,Penelope Tsilika,Alexandra Anger,Billy Ziogas",R,David Cronenberg,"Lucky Red,MK2 Mile End,MUBI,MUBI,Metropolitan Filmexport,Neon,O2 Play,Shaw Organisation,Spentzos Films,The Searchers,Vertigo Releasing,Vertigo Releasing,Weltkino Filmverleih,Amazon Instant Video,Amazon Prime Video,Argonauts,Capella Film,Capella Film,Film1,Front Row Filmed Entertainment,Leonine Distribution,MUBI,MUBI,MUBI,MUBI,MUBI,MUBI,MUBI,Madman Entertainment,Madman Films,Movie Cloud,Noori Pictures,Pris Audiovisuais,Remain In Light,Remain In Light,Rocket Science,The Searchers,Tohokushinsha Film Corporation (TFC),Twelve Oaks Pictures,Weltkino Filmverleih","Serendipity Point Films,Téléfilm Canada,Ingenious Media,Argonauts,Crave,Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC),Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT),Rocket Science,Ekome,Greek Film Centre (GFC),Ontario Creates,Bell Media,Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC),Super Ecran,Wiffle Films","Drama,Horror,Sci-Fi",107

With only minutes on the clock, Collins must utilize her years of tactical training and military expertise to determine who she can trust and stop Kessel and his covert mercenaries from completing their twisted and terrible mission. When the American interceptor launch station of nuclear warheads in Fort Greely, in Alaska, has a terrorist attack by their own men, the platform SBX-1 in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is the only protection of the United States. Meanwhile sixteen nuclear warheads are taken from the Russian arsenal by the terrorists. Captain J. J. Collins is reassigned to the remote platform SBX-1 after a process of sexual harassment of a popular general. Collins is hated by the Army, and her fellow soldiers have humiliated and despised her in retaliation. When she arrives on the platform, her superior, Lieutenant Colonel Clark Marshall, orders her to come armed to the central station, where she will work with Corporal Rahul Shah and the obnoxious Beaver Baker. Marshall exposes that Fort Greely has been destroyed by terrorists and they are the only defense of the United States. Out of the blue, they are attacked by seven American janitors led by Alexander Kessel that kill Marshall, but Collins succeeds to lock herself with Shah and the fainted Beaver in the control room. She reports the attack to the American government and the President and now she is in charge until the Seals arrive. But Kessel and his men killed everybody on board and is opening the first access door to the station with blowtorches. The tough Collins is the only resistance to hold the station until the Seals arrive.

On June 23, 2018, twelve boys of the junior football team ""Wild Boars"" and their assistant coach Ekkaphon Chanthawong leave practice to explore the Tham Luang cave. When the team fails to arrive at a birthday party organized by their parents, their families head to the caves, only to find them flooded and the boys missing, their bikes left at the entrance. The parents immediately alert emergency services. Royal Thai Navy SEALs, led by Captain Arnont (Teerapat Sajakul), arrive to search for the missing boys, but find the dive too difficult to locate the team. Vernon Unsworth (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), a local British caver, shares his extensive knowledge of the complex and dangerous cave and suggests the authorities get in touch with the British Cave Rescue Council. British cavers Rick Stanton (Viggo Mortensen) and John Volanthen (Colin Farrell) travel to Thailand and attempt the dive, finding the boys and coach four kilometers from the entrance. During an attempt to deliver air tanks to the boys to keep them alive in preparation for the rescue, former Thai Navy Seal Saman Kunan (Sukollawat Kanarot) drowns. Meanwhile, as hundreds of volunteers try to mitigate poor weather conditions, a water technician from Bangkok gains the permission of local farmers to divert water from the mountain onto their fields, destroying their crop. Realizing the boys will have to be removed through the cave, via a 6-hour dive, knowing the risks are, Stanton and Volanthen contact Dr. Richard Harris (Joel Edgerton), plus supporting divers Chris Jewell (Tom Bateman) and Jason Mallinson (Paul Gleeson).

204,5. Sisu,2022,"When an ex-soldier who discovers gold in the Lapland wilderness tries to take the loot into the city, German soldiers led by a brutal SS officer battle him. During the last desperate days of WWII, a solitary prospector (Jorma Tommila) crosses paths with Germans on a scorched-earth retreat in northern Finland. When the Germans steal his gold, they quickly discover that they have just tangled with no ordinary miner. While there is no direct translation for the Finnish word ""sisu"", this legendary ex-commando will embody what sisu means: a white-knuckled form of courage and unimaginable determination in the face of overwhelming odds. And no matter what the Germans throw at him, the one-man death squad will go to outrageous lengths to get his gold back - even if it means killing every last German in his path. Lionsgate presents, in association with Stage 6 Films, a Subzero Film Entertainment production, in association with Good Chaos.—Lionsgate Northern Finland, 1944. With the hideous scars of battle on his sinewy body betraying a violent past, grizzled prospector Aatami Korpi has sworn to leave the war behind him. But the Germans are everywhere--the more the Finns drive the enemy out of scorched Lapland, the more Adolf Hitler's strays are determined to destroy everything in their path, and now, of all times, fortune smiles upon the solitary prospector. Unfortunately, as the precious discovery attracts unwanted attention, Korpi soon finds himself up against an armed-to-the-teeth Wehrmacht platoon bent on snatching his priceless shiny nuggets. But no one steals from Aatami--not even crazed, gun-toting Germans desperate for a way out.—Nick Riganas 1944. In the Soviet Union and Finland signing the Moscow Treaty which in part leaves the responsibility of driving the Germans out of Finland to the Finns, the German response, in their retreat largely from their bases in Finnish Lapland to Norway, literally is to rape in taking some young women by force for their sexual pleasure and pillage leaving a barren wasteland in their wake. While one German platoon in retreat led by ranking officer Bruno Helldorf has done exactly all the aforementioned, they meet their match in an encounter with an elderly prospector seemingly with nothing except what he is carrying with him on his horse. After the elderly prospector gets the better of them in their initial encounter, Helldorf has a different perspective on the situation both learning who the prospector is - namely a former Finnish commando named Aatami Korpi gone rogue - and that he has with him a small cache of gold. Helldorf sees the gold as their ticket to survival in what looks to be the near end of the war in a German defeat, but wants to kill Aatami now more than ever merely out of principle.—Huggo",6.9,N/A,"Jorma Tommila,Aksel Hennie,Jack Doolan,Mimosa Willamo,Onni Tommila,Tatu Sinisalo,Wilhelm Enckell,Vincent Willestrand,Arttu Kapulainen,Elina Saarela,Ilkka Koivula,Max Ovaska,Joel Hirvonen,Pekka Huotari,Severi Saarinen,Aamu Milonoff,Joonas Brilli,Nicholas Francett,Kevin Francett,Eemeli Franssi,Jussi Kaila,Jarkko Klemetti,Henri Koljonen,Pekka Laakso,Martti Näätä Leinonen,Joosua Oja,Pietari Paappanen,Oskari Skyttä,Tomi Lampinen,Mila Leppälä,Jasmi Mäenpää,Nora Nevia,Jenna Tyni,Anssi-Pekka Fredriksson,Jarmo Hietamäki,Wellu Mikkonen,Akseli Hakovirta,Juho-Lauri Hakovirta,Iisko Hirvasvuopio,Sakari Maliniemi,Jukka Vuorela,Ari Joki,Nikita Makkojev,Jasmin Valjas,Linnea Vilppunen,Hannu Anttila,Mario Esposito,Tarmo Hassinen,Miia Heikkinen,Kimmo Henriksson,Arto Kairajärvi,Risto Korhonen,Mirva Korvala,Steven Madlin,Julia Malmsten,Annika Moisio,Kari Parkkinen,Tommi Pelkonen,Arto Peltomäki,Leena Sormunen,Pekka Virkkunen,Jukka Virtanen,Tinwelindon Belbog",R,Jalmari Helander,"Lionsgate,Big Picture 2 Films,Columbia Pictures Corporation,Feelgood Entertainment,GSC Movies (GSCM),Just Entertainment,Nordisk Film,Nordisk Film,Nordisk Film,Nordisk Film,Praesens-Film,SND Films,Sony Pictures Entertainment Iberia,Sony Pictures Filmverleih,Sony Pictures Releasing,Sony Pictures Releasing,Amazon Prime Video,Apple TV+,Lionsgate Home Entertainment,Lionsgate Home Entertainment,Lionsgate Home Entertainment,M6 Vidéo,M6 Vidéo,MTV3,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Starz,TME Films,Universal Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","Subzero Film Entertainment,Good Chaos,Stage 6 Films","Action,War",91

Tár,2022,"Set in the international world of Western classical music, the film centers on Lydia Tár, widely considered one of the greatest living composer-conductors and the very first female director of a major German orchestra. Having achieved an enviable career few could even dream of, renowned conductor/composer Lydia Tár, the first female principal music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, is at the top of her game. As a conductor, Lydia not only orchestrates, she manipulates. As a trailblazer, the passionate virtuoso leads the way in the male-dominated classical music industry. Lydia prepares for the release of her memoir while juggling work and family. She is also willing to take up one of her most significant challenges: a live recording of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 5. However, forces that even the imperious maestro can't control slowly chip away at Lydia's elaborate facade, revealing the genius's dirty secrets and the insidious, corrosive nature of power.

Two-time Academy Award® nominee Carey Mulligan (Promising Young Woman, An Education) and Emmy nominee Zoe Kazan (The Plot Against America, The Big Sick) star as New York Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, who together broke one of the most important stories in a generation--a story that shattered decades of silence around the subject of sexual assault in Hollywood and impelled a shift in American culture that continues to this day.—Official synopsis New York City, 2016. Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, journalists for the New York Times, have spent months reaching out to abuse survivors to open up to them about predatory Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's sexual misconduct and power abuse. For this reason, the two working mothers deal with stress and exhaustion as they uncover a three-decade history of intimidation, extreme harassment, and rape that spans as far back as the 1980s. And in their unrelenting pursuit of the truth, the two investigative reporters confront years of silence and an extensive, well-organised system protecting male abusers. But as the two journalists give the objectified women a chance to tell their stories, their detailed accounts of repeated harassment and sexual assault spark a global movement.

244,"20. Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile",2022,"Feature film based on the children's book about a crocodile that lives in New York City. Follows the title reptile who lives in a house on East 88th Street in New York City. Lyle enjoys helping the Primm family with everyday chores and playing with the neighborhood kids but one neighbor insists that Lyle belongs in a zoo. Mr. Grumps and his cat, Loretta, do not like crocodiles, and Lyle tries to prove that he is not as bad as others might first think. In New York City, a charismatic magician named Hector P. Valenti wants to try out on a national talent show but is constantly rejected. One day after a failed audition, he wanders into an exotic pet store, where he finds a singing baby crocodile and names him Lyle. Seeing Lyle as an opportunity to become rich in the talent business, he places his three-story Victorian brownstone house as collateral for their performance, but Lyle experiences stage fright during the premiere and Hector loses the house. Hector is forced to move out and reluctantly leaves Lyle to fend for himself while he tries to make more money. Eighteen months later, Mr. and Mrs. Primm and their young son Josh move into the house. Josh is initially terrified of moving into his new home and struggles to make friends at school. One night, he discovers Lyle, now fully grown, living in the attic, and they become friends when Lyle saves Josh from a mugger and demonstrates his singing talent. Josh's stepmother and father eventually find out about Lyle, and though initially terrified of him, bond with Lyle over their favorite hobbies. One day, Hector returns to the house to visit Lyle, as an agreement states he can live in the house fifteen days a year. He makes another attempt to get Lyle to perform on stage, but it fails as Lyle still has stage fright, apart from when performing for the Primms. Meanwhile, Alistair Grumps, the Primms' unfriendly downstairs neighbor, becomes annoyed by the loud activity caused by Lyle, Hector, and the Primms. Determined to put an end to it, he has cameras installed to discover what is happening but manages to achieve his goal by bribing Hector to sell out Lyle in exchange for money to pay his debts. Lyle cannot convince the authorities of his benevolent nature because of his stage fright and is locked up at the zoo. Feeling guilty for what he did to Lyle, Hector goes to break him out of the zoo with Josh's help, who was initially unwilling to help after learning Hector sold Lyle out. On Josh's insistence, Hector and Lyle reconcile with each other before Lyle escapes with Josh to the talent show, while Hector distracts the authorities. On stage, Lyle manages to overcome his stage fright with help from Josh, receiving acclaim from the audience and viewers for his singing talent. One month later, a trial is held to determine whether or not Lyle may be free. The judge ultimately decides to rule over Grumps in favor of Lyle when Hector reveals that the deed to his house was written out to his grandmother, that was hidden away under Grumps' bed, who built the house and founded the New York City Zoo where Lyle was previously kept, allowing her to keep exotic animals as pets. After the trial, the Primms celebrate Lyle's freedom, and Grumps' implied eviction, by taking him on vacation, while Hector becomes acquainted with a new talented animal: a beatboxing rattlesnake named Malfoy, owned by Josh's friend, Trudy.—elwarts",6.1,"$50,000,000 (estimated)","Javier Bardem,Winslow Fegley,Shawn Mendes,Constance Wu,Scoot McNairy,Brett Gelman,Ego Nwodim,Lyric Hurd,Jason Kravits,Ben Palacios,Joshua Vasquez,Marc Farley,Sal Viscuso,Adam Murray,Mary Neely,Don DiPetta,Lindsey Moser,Matthew Risch,Clayton English,Michael Lawson,Jef Holbrook,Matthew Wilkas,Lauren Boyd,Reif Howey,Evangeline Miller,Jene Moore,Chance Mizell,Christine Moon,Angela Davis,Kathryn Orlando,Caden Brillantes,Kyson Galligan,Alton Williams,Thomas Williams,Irving Thigpen,Matt Rogers,Eric Rutherford,Eboni Nichols,Taylor James,Donnie Cormier,Rick Pearson,Al Thompson,Bethania Ahadu,Nick D.

281,7. Emancipation,2022,"A runaway slave forges through the swamps of Louisiana on a tortuous journey to escape plantation owners that nearly killed him. Over 150 years from today, back in 1863 at Lousiana, a black slave, Gordon, had dreamt of the freedom of black people. Freedom means living their life to the fullest, just like their ""White"" masters: who considered themselves god of 'these Animals'. 'Emancipation' is a tale of a black slave who fought his whole life to live with honor, dignity, and of course, a ""Normal life"" This is the tale of a person who risked his life to join the Lincoln Army, fighting to free his fellow brothers-sisters-sons-daughters. This image of Gordon was taken in 1863 after he managed to be free from his slave master. This is the most accurate depiction of slavery I've seen. In America in 1863, Peter is a black American forced into rigorous manual labour in plantations and subjected to torture by the owners. When slavery is abolished by President Lincoln he escapes and is chased through jungles and swamps by his oppressors. Does he achieve freedom after undergoing suffering ?—madanmarwah",6.3,"$120,000,000 (estimated)","Will Smith,Ben Foster,Charmaine Bingwa,Gilbert Owuor,Ronnie Gene Blevins,Aaron Moten,Jabbar Lewis,Michael Luwoye,Steven Ogg,Grant Harvey,Mustafa Shakir,Paul Ben-Victor,David Denman,Jesse C.

While staying at an isolated island resort, James (Alexander Skarsgård) and Em (Cleopatra Coleman) are enjoying a perfect vacation of pristine beaches, exceptional staff, and soaking up the sun. But guided by the seductive and mysterious Gabi (Mia Goth), they venture outside the resort grounds and find themselves in a culture filled with violence, hedonism, and untold horror.—Official synopsis After six slow years of inactivity, unsuccessful novelist James Foster now questions his talent. And at this point in life, James is willing to try everything to overcome the chronic writer's block--perhaps the sandy beaches and the picturesque serenity of a tropical paradise would do the trick. Instead, as the blocked author and his supportive publishing heiress wife, Em, look for inspiration in an exclusive resort overlooking the sea, a millisecond of inattention destroys the couple's tomorrows. Now, isolated from reality and bound by the draconian laws of a strange land, James and Em have some tough, life-altering decisions to make. But money buys everything. As things get out of hand, can those who can afford sin find a loophole to save their skin?—Nick Riganas The writer James Foster and his wealthy wife Em Foster travel to a luxurious resort in Li Tolq. James is seeking inspiration to write a second book since his first one was a total failure with bad reviews. They meet the tourist Gabi Bauer, who is spending vacation in the resort with her husband Alban Bauer, and she tells James that she is her fan. James and Em are invited by Alban and Gabi to have dinner at a fancy Chinese restaurant, and they invite the couple to go with them outside the resort on the next morning. Due to the stringent local laws, it is forbidden to the tourists to leave the compound, but Alban rents a car from one employee, and they spend the day drinking at a paradisiacal beach. When they return late night, Alban is drunken, and James offers to drive. However, he hits a farmer on the road and his friends says that he should not call the police since they are very violent. After the hit and run, they return to the resort, but on the next morning, James and Em are arrested. James learns that in accordance with the local law, the next of kin of the victim has the right to kill the murderer. However, he may use a duplicate to replace him since he is a tourist, provided he pays a large amount. James and Em are forced to watch the death of his clone and are released.

331,7. Jesus Revolution,2023,"The true story of a national spiritual awakening in the early 1970s and its origins within a community of teenage hippies in Southern California. Tells the story of a young Greg Laurie (Joel Courtney) being raised by his struggling mother, Charlene (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) in the 1970s. Laurie and a sea of young people descend on sunny Southern California to redefine truth through all means of liberation. Inadvertently, Laurie meets Lonnie Frisbee (Jonathan Roumie), a charismatic hippie-street-preacher, and Pastor Chuck Smith (Kelsey Grammer) who have thrown open the doors of Smith's languishing church to a stream of wandering youth. What unfolds becomes the greatest spiritual awakening in American history. Rock and roll, newfound love, and a twist of faith lead to a JESUS REVOLUTION that turns one counterculture movement into a revival that changes the world.—Lionsgate The movie tells the story of Chuck Smith, a Southern California pastor in the late 1960s, struggling to connect with the younger, free-spirited generation of hippies. One day, his daughter Janette gives a ride to a hippie hitchhiker named Lonnie Frisbee, who introduces Chuck to the Ministry of Jesus. Initially suspicious, Chuck warms up to Lonnie and welcomes other hippies to his house. Together, they start a successful movement to evangelize hippies and others. Meanwhile, high school student Greg Laurie runs away from his military class and joins a girl named Cathe who introduces him to the counterculture and drugs. After seeing the dangers of drug use, Greg and Cathe find solace at Chuck and Lonnie's ministry. However, Cathe's strict parents are not enthusiastic about Greg. The ministry gains notoriety and attracts media attention, being referred to as ""Jesus Freaks"". However, there are internal disagreements that lead to one member leaving the group, while another takes over a new ministry branch and becomes a prominent figure in the religious community. The original founders of the movement are remembered as influential leaders in the Jesus movement.—Frank Liesenborgs Dramatizes the real life unlikely convergence of beliefs in late-1960s Southern California. Chuck Smith Jr. is the pastor of the mostly empty Calvary Chapel, and thus is becoming less and less relevant professionally in society in preaching to those exactly like him: middle age and conservative. He is also becoming less and less connected to his now teen daughter Janette Smith, who considers him, to use her vernacular, the squarest person in the world. In he not understanding or having met hippies who Janette says are just trying to find love and peace in the world, he is surprised when Janette takes him up on what was his joke offer to bring a hippie into their home to speak to him. That hippie is Lonnie Frisbee, physically looking like Jesus, Lonnie who ends up transforming Chuck's view of life and religion, much against the comfort felt by his conservative congregation. Into Chuck and Lonnie's new movement enters teenagers Greg Laurie and his girlfriend Cathe Martin. Living in a trailer on the beach with his single party-hearty mother Charlene, Greg was attending military school in Charlene wanting some discipline in his life, when he ventured to the nearby high school where he met upper middle class Cathe, who opened his eyes to a less structured environment that was her social circle. As Chuck and Lonnie's movement, now including Greg and Cathe, started to grow to epic proportions, the questions become whether that success would overtake what was inherent to what made them a success and whether their alliances could withstand the pressures of that success.—Huggo",7.1,"$15,000,000 (estimated)","Joel Courtney,Jonathan Roumie,Kimberly Williams-Paisley,Anna Grace Barlow,Kelsey Grammer,Nic Bishop,Jackson Robert Scott,Nicholas Cirillo,Ally Ioannides,Julia Campbell,Mina Sundwall,DeVon Franklin,Charlie Morgan Patton,Jolie Jenkins,Sidney Floyd,Erin Schaut,Randall Newsome,Brian Shoop,Grant Owens,Steve Hanks,Julian Hacquebard,Joshua Vaughn,Trevor Tallakson,Pierce Lackey,Ezra Proch,Sakena Bebe,Todd Terry,Paras Patel,Matthew Montemaro,D'Andre Noiré,Jean St. James,Nick Kayea,Jordan Andrusky,Shaun Weiss,Kevin Downes,Wendy Wynne,Angie Lynn,Josh Herren,Glenn Boychuk,Maria Arroyo,John L.

346,22. Limbo,2023,"'Limbo' follows the investigation of a twenty year-old outback cold case murder by jaded detective Travis Hurley. Simon Baker stars as Travis Hurley, a detective who arrives in a small Australian outback city to research a twenty-year-old unsolved homicide of a neighborhood Aboriginal lady. Forming bonds with the sufferer's fractured household, Travis unravels a collection of arduous truths, highlighting the complexities of loss and injustice skilled by First Nations Australians.—Official Summary A Simon Baker stars as Travis Hurley, a detective who arrives in a small Australian outback town to investigate a twenty- year-old unsolved murder of a local Aboriginal girl. Forming bonds with the victim's fractured family, Travis unravels a series of hard truths, highlighting the complexities of loss and injustice experienced by First Nations Australians.—Official Summary B Detective Travis Hurley arrives in a small town in the Australian outback. The Hotel Limbo, which resembles a rocky grotto, proves to be perfect for his very own particular type of relaxation. But he has come here to investigate a case from 20 years ago for which the only evidence is a number of tape recordings: the unsolved murder of an Aboriginal girl named Charlotte Hayes. The residents are less than forthcoming regarding the provision of information; this is especially true of the victim's fractured family. You do not talk to a cop, especially if he is white. But Hurley, in a stoic performance by Simon Baker, knows how to wend his way in his cool car through the labyrinthine landscape of the Opal Mountains and form a bond with the cave and caravan dwellers. Indigenous Australian film director Ivan Sen is renowned for his depiction of magnificent screen landscapes. In Limbo, he juxtaposes the low sky with the mounds above and holes below ground around the opal-mining capital of Coober Pedy. The result is a serene ""desert noir"" that is as convincing as a detective story as it is a subtle portrait of the First Nation's deep-seated experiences of everyday racism.

381,"7. Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",2023,"Eleven-year-old Margaret moves from the city to the suburbs and starts to contemplate everything about life, friendship and adolescence. She relies on her mother, Barbara, who offers loving support, and her grandmother, Sylvia. Margaret Simon is just 11 going on 12 when her family moves from New York City to Fartbrook, New Jersey. Margaret's mother is Christian and her father is Jewish. Margaret has been raised without an affiliation to either faith, and does not practice an organized religion, although she frequently prays to God in her own words, beginning by saying, ""Are you there God? It's me, Margaret."" She is beginning to feel uncomfortable with her lack of a religious affiliation. For a school assignment, she chooses to study people's religious beliefs, hoping to resolve the question of her own religion in the process. Part of her study involves attending different places of worship to better understand religious practice and also to see if one of them might be right for her. She enjoys spending time with her Jewish paternal grandmother, Sylvia Simon, who loves her as she is, and hopes Margaret will embrace Judaism after taking her to her synagogue for Rosh Hashanah services.—It was spelled incorrectly For over fifty years, Judy Blume's classic Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. has connected with readers through its relatable story, achingly funny details, and candid exploration of life's biggest questions. In Lionsgate's big-screen adaptation, 11-year-old Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson) is uprooted from her life in New York City for the suburbs of New Jersey, going through the messy and tumultuous throes of puberty with new friends in a new school. She relies on her mother, Barbara (Rachel McAdams), who is also struggling to adjust to life outside the big city, and her adoring grandmother, Sylvia (Kathy Bates), who isn't happy they moved away and likes to remind them every chance she gets. The film also stars Benny Safdie (Licorice Pizza, Good Time) and is written for the screen and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig (The Edge of Seventeen), based on the book by Judy Blume, and produced by Gracie Films' Academy Award® winner James L. Brooks (Best Picture, 1983 - Terms of Endearment), alongside Julie Ansell. Richard Sakai, Kelly Fremon Craig, Judy Blume, Amy Lorraine Brooks, Aldric La'auli Porter, and executive produced by Jonathan McCoy.—Lionsgate 1970. Despite not having lived in a home with religion, eleven year old Margaret Simon starts talking to God in feeling she has no one else to turn to when she believes her life has ended in her parents, Herb and Barbara Simon, deciding to move the family from New York City, the only world Margaret has ever known which includes close contact with Herb's overbearing but loving Jewish mother, Sylvia Simon, to suburban New Jersey in Herb changing jobs. In this new world, Margaret, not knowing what is expected of her, tries solely to fit in being befriended by outwardly confidant classmate Nancy Wheeler, who invites Margaret to join her secret club of four girls total. The nature of the club is for them to talk about what eleven year girls obsess about, namely the issues of puberty, including their changing bodies, most specifically the development of breasts and menstruation, and their developing attraction to boys, as well as gossip about others based solely on outward appearances. Through it all, Margaret feels the need to conform even if it isn't truly what she is feeling and despite the club's motto always to tell the truth. Margaret also learns about the reason for not having a religion and why she has never met her maternal grandparents: Barbara being disowned by her devout Christian parents in marrying someone Jewish, it the reason Herb and Barbara will ultimately let Margaret decide for herself if she ever wants religion in her life. In testing out religions, Margaret may decide if and when she actually does feel God answer any of the questions she has been asking of him. This move is also as much an adjustment for her parents, especially Barbara in giving up her job as an art teacher to become her version of a suburban housewife, which for her means a focus on the house including learning how to cook and being an active participant in the PTA. But Barbara may find that her expectations may not match the reality of what she wants out of this life.—Huggo",7.3,"$30,000,000 (estimated)","Abby Ryder Fortson,Rachel McAdams,Kathy Bates,Benny Safdie,Elle Graham,Amari Alexis Price,Katherine Mallen Kupferer,Kate MacCluggage,Aidan Wojtak-Hissong,Landon S.

401,2. Fast X,2023,"Dom Toretto and his family are targeted by the vengeful son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes. The end of the road begins. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast and Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema's most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began. Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they've ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who's fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything-and everyone-that Dom loves, forever. In 2011's Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn't know was that Reyes' son, Dante (Aquaman's Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. Dante's plot will scatter Dom's family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante's vengeance. Directed by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. The film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn't hold the same fondness for Dom's crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom's past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia's Abuelita Toretto. Fast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback.—www.thefastsaga.com The final road begins! Dom Torretto and his family have made it through thick and thin together while succeeding in various missions and fighting off multiple villains.

Caligula: The Ultimate Cut,2023,"Follows Caligula as he kills his devious adoptive grandfather and takes control of the decadent Roman Empire, spiralling into depravity, devastation, and madness. Absolute power corrupts in CALIGULA: THE ULTIMATE CUT, an extensive reconstruction of the notorious 1980 spectacle. Shadowed by the murder of his family, Caligula eliminates his devious adoptive grandfather and seizes control of the Roman Empire alongside his wife Caesonia before descending into a spiral of depravity, destruction, and madness.—Drafthouse Films In a meticulous effort to align more closely with Gore Vidal's original screenplay, producer Thomas Negovan presents the originally envisaged version of the controversial Caligula (1979). Excluding Penthouse founder Bob Guccione's inserted scenes, this 178-minute Ultimate Cut represents a comprehensive reconstruction and restoration of the 1979 release edited entirely from scratch without incorporating any frames from the original theatrical version. Using previously unreleased footage, the film features a newly composed musical score and an engaging opening title sequence. Set in 37 A.D. Rome, the narrative chronicles the rise of Prince Gaius Augustus Germanicus, known as Caligula, who ascends to the imperial throne following the assassination of the deranged Emperor Tiberius. Corrupted by the intoxicating nature of absolute power, the tyrannical Caligula proclaims himself a god, marries his beloved sister Drusilla, and elevates Incitatus, his favoured horse, to a position of nobility. Trapped in a relentless cycle of excess, Caligula betrays his allies, obliterates innocence, and eliminates his adversaries through acts of torture and execution, only for the Roman Empire to pay him back in the same coin.—Nick Riganas A dramatization of the ascent to Caesar and subsequent reign of Caligula, one of the most notorious leaders of ancient Rome.

Fool's Paradise is a satirical comedy following a down-on-his-luck publicist (Ken Jeong), who gets his lucky break when he discovers a man recently released from a mental health facility (Day) looks just like a method actor who refuses to leave his trailer. With the help of a powerful producer (the late Ray Liotta), Ken helps the man become a huge star, even marrying his beautiful leading lady (Kate Beckinsale). Their adventures lead them to cross paths with drunken costars (Adrien Brody), irreverent unhoused action heroes (Common), unpredictable directors (Jason Sudeikis), a super-agent (Edie Falco), and power-mad moguls (John Malkovich). Fame and fortune are not all they are cracked up to be, and the two men must fight their way back to the things that matter the most.—Deadline Hollywood The story follows a mute man named John Doe, who has the mental capacity of a five-year-old. After being released from a mental hospital due to the state's inability to afford his treatment, John Doe ends up being homeless and takes directions from whoever he encounters. Meanwhile, a film producer, frustrated with actor Sir Tom Bingsley's refusal to leave his trailer during the shooting of a biopic about Billy the Kid, hires John Doe as a stand-in due to their uncanny resemblance. On the other hand, Lenny, a struggling publicist, aims to find talent by bribing his way onto studio lots. He mistakes John Doe's name for ""Latte Pronto"" due to a coffee-related demand from the producer. When Bingsley's method acting goes awry and he dies, John Doe, now referred to as Pronto, is forced to continue filming as the star. Despite his lack of acting skills and tendency to look directly into the camera, Pronto's co-stars, Christiana Dior and Chad Luxt, find inspiration in his supposed avant-garde performance and begin emulating his acting style. Lenny plans to catapult Pronto to stardom by securing him an agent and representation. Pronto befriends Luxt, who introduces him to the extravagant Hollywood lifestyle and takes him to wild parties. At the same time, Dior develops feelings for Pronto due to his genuine nature and convinces him to marry her, leading to increased media attention. The film ""Billy the Kid"" becomes a huge success, with critics applauding Pronto's unique breaking of the fourth wall by looking into the camera.

From filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos and producer Emma Stone comes the incredible tale and fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter (Stone), a young woman crafted by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) using an infant's brain and her dead mother's body. Under Baxter's protection, Bella is eager to learn. Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella experiences sexual liberation and a desire for equality.—Searchlight Pictures The corpse of a dead woman is reanimated with the brain of her infant daughter by a brilliant, eccentric scientist. He names her Bella and grooms her in the ways of life. She is however impatient to see the world and is lead on a journey of sexual discovery beyond the walls of her creator's estate, leading to a multitude of experiences evolving her views on womanhood and equality.—Madan Marwah Sheltered from negative influence behind the tall stone walls of Dr Godwin Baxter's Victorian garden of grotesque wonders, exotic Bella has no clue about what she's been missing out on life. But ideas are impossible to contain; like a fierce tempest, nothing can stand in the way of freedom and enlightenment. Now, seduced by the electrifying scent of promise and opportunity, the voracious, raven-haired disciple embarks on a grand globe-trotting quest for self-awareness, eager to broaden her horizons. And the question remains. Equipped with childish curiosity and the feral desire to answer the haunting whys that hinder her evolution, can the bizarre anatomist's favourite poor thing survive the world's twisted love on her own?—Nick Riganas In London, Godwin Baxter is a scientist and surgeon of some renown, although some of his students believe him to be a literal monster in the vein of Dr. Frankenstein's. He has as his ward Bella Baxter, an infant literally in the reanimated corpse of a young woman. Godwin acknowledges to those in his circle that he doesn't know her history before she came into his life, and to protect her and himself he keeps her confined to his compound. As science is his life, he hires one of his students, Max McCandles, to monitor Bella's developmental progress but Max is unaware of exactly what he is walking into in accepting the position. Upon learning of Bella's true circumstances, at least as Godwin knows, he buys into who he represents in Bella's life with Godwin's blessing and Godwin makes legal arrangements for Bella's future again, to protect both her and himself. As such, egotistical barrister Duncan Wedderburn enters their lives, unaware of Bella's background except what he was asked to draw up for her legally. Falling under Bella's spell, Duncan, with Godwin's knowledge, whisks her away outside of the compound, thus exposing Bella to another developmental process, steered largely by Duncan and the world to which he introduces her.—Huggo",7.8,"$35,000,000 (estimated)","Emma Stone,Willem Dafoe,Vicki Pepperdine,Ramy Youssef,Jack Barton,Charlie Hiscock,Attila Dobai,Emma Hindle,Anders Olof Grundberg,Attila Kecskeméthy,Mark Ruffalo,Jucimar Barbosa,Carminho,Angela Paula Stander,Gustavo Gomes,Kate Handford,Owen Good,Zen Joshua Poisson,Vivienne Soan,Jerskin Fendrix,István Göz,Bruna Asdorian,Tamás Szabó Sipos,Tom Stourton,Hanna Schygulla,Jerrod Carmichael,Margaret Qualley,Mascuud Dahir,Miles Jovian,Jeremy Wheeler,János Geréb,Kathryn Hunter,Patrick de Valette,Raphaël Thiéry,Suzy Bemba,Boris Gillot,Dorina Kovács,Yorgos Stefanakos,Hubert Benhamdine,Laurent Borel,Gábor Patay,Laurent Winkler,Andrew Hefler,Damien Bonnard,Noah Breton,Donovan Fouassier,Wayne Brett,Christopher Abbott,John Locke,Keeley Forsyth,David Bromley,Gergo Borbas,Roderick Hill,Hisham Omer,Sam Pembroke,Celina Schleicher,Alexandra Tóth",R,Yorgos Lanthimos,"Searchlight Pictures,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Feelgood Entertainment,Forum Hungary,NOS Audiovisuais,Press Play Pictures,Searchlight Pictures,Walt Disney Company France,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Argentina,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Germany,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,Amazon Prime Video,Apple TV+,Hulu,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,The Walt Disney Company Iberia","Element Pictures,Film4,Fruit Tree,Hungarian Tax Credit,Searchlight Pictures,TSG Entertainment","Comedy,Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi",141

His Three Daughters,2023,"This tense, touching and funny portrait of family dynamics follows three estranged sisters as they converge in a New York apartment to care for their ailing father and try to mend their own broken relationship with one another. From writer-director Azazel Jacobs (French Exit, The Lovers) comes this bittersweet and often funny story of an elderly patriarch and the three grown daughters who come to be with him in his final days. Katie is a controlling Brooklyn mother dealing with a wayward teenage daughter; free-spirited Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) is a different kind of mom, separated from her offspring for the first time; and Rachel (Natasha Lyonne) is a sports-betting stoner who has never left her father's apartment - much to the chagrin of her step-sisters, who share a different worldview. Continuing his astute exploration of family dynamics in close-knit spaces, Jacobs follows the siblings over the course of three volatile days, as death looms, grievances erupt, and love seeps through the cracks of a fractured home. Three sisters come together to be near their bedridden and dying father in his last days. While they are closeted together in an apartment for a few days they argue and quarrel over forgotten events of the past but they also make up and apologize soon afterwards resulting in a much needed healing of their relationship.—Madan Marwah",7.2,N/A,"Carrie Coon,Natasha Lyonne,Elizabeth Olsen,Rudy Galvan,Jose Febus,Randy Ramos Jr.,Jovan Adepo,Jasmine Bracey,Jay O.

551,4. Napoleon,2023,"An epic that details the chequered rise and fall of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and his relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his wife, Josephine. Napoleon is a spectacle-filled action epic that details the checkered rise and fall of the iconic French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, played by Oscar®-winner Joaquin Phoenix. Against a stunning backdrop of large-scale filmmaking orchestrated by legendary director Ridley Scott, the film captures Bonaparte's relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his one true love, Josephine, showcasing his visionary military and political tactics against some of the most dynamic practical battle sequences ever filmed.—Sony Pictures Ridley Scott's ambitious attempt to portray Napoleon is a monotone epic covering decades of French history immediately following the birth of the United States. The Colonies don't win their independence without the support of the French, yet Scott focuses on the tumultuous, decade-long French Revolution without so much as a tip of the hat toward the recently concluded American Revolution. The film focuses on a man confident in his abilities as a military strategist, infused with terrific ambition, and a desire to bring Europe peace through war. A figure who resonates centuries after his time, the Napoleon represented here by Joaquin Phoenix presents a dour man who through sheer will wins the affection of the love of his life, Josephine. However, Napoleon is pulled by an obsession stronger than his love for Josephine. His desire for acceptance by the aristocracy of the other major European powers and their petty conflicts. It leads to his making war to extend French control beyond her borders. General turned Emperor, Napoleon seeks to achieve through conquest what he could not otherwise, but it leads to exile, resurrection, and eventually downfall.",6.3,"$200,000,000 (estimated)","Joaquin Phoenix,Vanessa Kirby,Tahar Rahim,Rupert Everett,Mark Bonnar,Paul Rhys,Ben Miles,Riana Duce,Ludivine Sagnier,Edouard Philipponnat,Miles Jupp,Scott Handy,Youssef Kerkour,John Hollingworth,Abubakar Salim,Thom Ashley,Jannis Niewöhner,Julian Rhind-Tutt,John Hodgkinson,Erin Ainsworth,Isabella Brownson,Benjamin Chivers,Sam Meakin,Sinéad Cusack,Harriet Bunton,Charlie Greenwood,Audrey Brisson,Matthew Needham,Sam Crane,Sam Troughton,Edward Bennett,Julian Wadham,Catherine Walker,Honor Kneafsey,Alexander Shaw,Phil Cornwell,Harry Taurasi,Edward Mercieca,Arthur McBain,Andy Burse,Jonathan Rice,Emeric Bernard-Jones,Bay Bryan,Michael Twaits,Michael O'Connor,Dominic Coleman,Ian McNeice,Richard McCabe,Tom Godwin,Gavin Spokes,Catherine Harvey,David Verrey,Benedict Martin,Edward Hogg,Ed Hughes,Jonathan Barnwell,Robin Soans,Abigail Weinstock,Bart Lambert,Joshua Leese,Nicholas Shaw,Anna Mawn,Imogen Slaughter,Mitchell Baggott,Ned Costello,John Mula,Kevin Eldon,Henry Morgan,Logan Truter,Saxon Fox,Richard Leeming,Billy Byers,Tim Faulkner,Peter Sandys-Clarke,Tim Delap,Charlie Barrett,Olivia Juno Cleverley,Sophie Wohlfeld,Cormac Hyde-Corrin,Hal Gavin,Michael Nardone,Chris Barltrop,Robert Goodman,Sophie Lund,Oliver Phillips,Morgan Watkins,Millie Ashford,Emily Barton,Miranda Bell,Rowena Bentley,Emma Billingsley,Philip Bird,Maximilian Soper Defreitas,Ed Eales White,Marnie Graham-Maw,Ania Marson,Kristin McIlquham,Douglas Russell,Matilda Shapland,Davide Tucci,Thea Achillea,Antony Barlow,Diego Barraza,Adam Bendall,Charlie Bentley,Lewis Blee,Elie Bouakaze,Dave Boyle,Archie Caswell-Chappell,Kieran Chalker,Lorris Chevalier,Stuart Cooke,Jooles Crabbe,Chris Crowson,Mark de Freitas,R.A.

577,5. The Boys in the Boat,2023,"A 1930s-set story centered on the University of Washington's rowing team, from their Depression-era beginnings. The Boys in the Boat is a sports drama based on the #1 New York Times bestselling non-fiction novel written by Daniel James Brown. The film, directed by George Clooney, is about the 1936 University of Washington rowing team that competed for gold at the Summer Olympics in Berlin. This inspirational true story follows a group of underdogs at the height of the Great Depression as they are thrust into the spotlight and take on elite rivals from around the world.—MGM There are two backstories. One illustrates how all nine members of the Washington team came from lower-middle-class families and had to struggle to earn their way through school during the depths of the Depression. Along with the chronicle of their victories and defeats in domestic competition, the reader learns the importance of the synchronization of the eight rowers as they respond to the commands of the coxswain and his communications with the stroke, consistent pacing, and sprint to the finish. The second backstory begins with a depiction of Hitler decreeing construction of the spectacular German venues at which the Games would take place. Along the way, the book also describes how the Nazis successfully covered up the evidence of their harsh and inhumane treatment of the Jews and other minorities so as to win worldwide applause for the Games, duping the United States Olympic Committee, among others. All comes together with a description of the final race. During the 1930s, rowing was a popular sport with millions following the action on the radio. Afterwards, they would come together every few years to row again.—tpsimpleman",7.0,"$40,000,000 (estimated)","Joel Edgerton,Callum Turner,Peter Guinness,Sam Strike,Thomas Elms,Jack Mulhern,Luke Slattery,Bruce Herbelin-Earle,Wil Coban,Tom Varey,Joel Phillimore,James Wolk,Hadley Robinson,Courtney Henggeler,Chris Diamantopoulos,Glenn Wrage,Edward Baker-Duly,Adrian Lukis,Dominic Tighe,Alec Newman,Andrew Bridgmont,Jack Staddon,Jacob James Beswick,Jyuddah Jaymes,Frankie Fox,Sam Douglas,David Stoller,Austin Haynes,Nicholas Cass-Beggs,Jan Stratmann,Johnny O'Dowd,Nick Tajan,Ian McElhinney,Robert Morgan,Laurel Lefkow,Matt Brewer,John Ammirati,Lorna Nickson Brown,Tyler Davis,Robert Cawsey,Joshua Akehurst,Kirsty MacLaren,George Alfie,Tom Claxton,Lucy Appleton,Jonathan Ball,Hannah Atwood,Gethin Alderman,Betsy Picart,Biz Lyon,Nancy Baldwin,Daniel Hayde,Serrana Su-Ling Bliss,Daniel Philpott,Andrew Cullum,Wally Wingert,Mark Silverman,Lucas Allermann,Fraser Anthony,Harry Axton,Andreas Bedorf,Ricky Bevins,Elliot Bird,Sam Bishop,Edward Brooks,Jaymes Butler,Gianni Calchetti,John Capel,Robert William Carlisle,Iain Carter,Graham Curry,Nick Davison,Liam Edwards,Nigel Finnissy,Sean Frost,Izzy Harradine,Luke Hayward,John Hughes,Laura Hughes,Milo James,Robert Jarvis,Christian Jones,Nicholas Joy,Daniel Kovacs,Fran Lawton,Callum Macreadie,Bob Mann,Ryan Mann,Andy M Milligan,Mariana Moreno,Ivan Moy,John Neil Park,Paul Parker,Christopher Parramore,Nathan Pegler,Trevor Puckett,Paul Riddell,Jerry Ronson,Stephen Samson,Samuel Sherpa-Moore,Lee Simmons,Dave Simon,Mick Slaney,Michael Smoker,Simon Strutt,David Thrower,Alex Vass,Ben Vincent,Patrick Walsh,Paul Warwick,Alan D West,John Whitby,Harry Whittaker,Andy Willis,Chris Wilson,Sachiko Yokoyama",PG-13,George Clooney,"Amazon MGM Studios,Warner Bros.,Amazon MGM Studios,Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM),Amazon Prime Video","Tempesta Films,Lantern Entertainment,Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,Smokehouse Pictures,Spyglass Entertainment","Biography,Drama,Sport",123

The Beekeeper,2024,"A kind-hearted landlady commits suicide after falling victim to a phishing scam, leading former ""Beekeeper"" operative Adam Clay to set out on a brutal campaign for revenge upon those responsible. Adam Clay is a beekeeper, but someone very important to him is scammed and driven to harm. However, what these power and money hungry scammers don't know, is that Clay is an agent in a classified program called Beekeepers, and they underestimate how much of a threat he is. Adam sets out on a quest of vengeance, where he hunts and kills those responsible for the incident. SPOILERS: In Hampden, Massachusetts, Adam Clay is a beekeeper who has several hives of bees. He rents some space in a barn owned by retired teacher Eloise Parker, a widow who owns and lives in the house on the property. While they both live alone, the two are friendly with one another -- Clay sees Eloise as the only person who ever took care of him. While checking some things on her laptop computer, Eloise sees a warning about two viruses in the system. She calls the number on the screen, and connects to a call center that's located in Springfield, Massachusetts, not aware that it's a phishing scam. The call center's manager, Mickey Garnett, cons Eloise out of everything -- including more than $2,000,000 that's in the account of Safe Homes Foundation, a children's charity whose account she manages. Devastated by the realization that she got scammed out of so much, Eloise shoots herself in the head. Adam finds Eloise's body in her house, and he's immediately arrested by Eloise's daughter, Boston-based FBI Special Agent Verona Parker, who hastily accuses Adam of shooting Eloise. Verona learns that Eloise was scammed out of every penny she had. Adam is quickly cleared when Eloise's death is ruled a suicide because there was no gunshot residue on Adam, and Eloise's fingerprints were the only prints on the gun. Verona apologizes to Adam for her accusation, and she tells him that the FBI cyber-crimes office has told her that the scammer crew that victimized Eloise has been operating for two years, but the FBI hasn't been able to identify any of the scammers. Verona vows to find the scammers, but Adam, enraged by what happened, decides to hunt down the scammers himself, and make them pay for what they did to Eloise. Upon learning the hard way that Adam is after them, Garnett explains the situation to the crew's ringleader, 28-year-old tech executive Derek Danforth, who runs a Boston-based corporation called Danforth Enterprises. Derek assigns the company's head of security, former CIA director Wallace Westwyld, to find a way to stop Adam. But Wallace learns that Adam is a retired member of a classified program called the Beekeepers, whose members are tasked with fighting different forms of corruption, operating above and beyond governmental jurisdiction. The Beekeepers are so efficient and well-trained that they make the military look like a joke. Wallace realizes that Adam is a man who should be feared by people like Derek. Adam proves to be an unstoppable force, and Derek, Garnett, and the rest of the scammers have no idea what kind of scorched-Earth hell Adam is about to unleash on them.—Todd Baldridge The beekeeper Adam Clay farms his bees and produces honey in a barn rented from the gentle landlady Eloise Parker, who treats him with affection. When she falls in a phishing scam, all her money, credit cards and the money of a charity institution that she is the administrator immediately vanishes from her account and she commits suicide. Adam visits her during the night and is surprised by her daughter, the FBI Agent Verona Parker that believes he is the killer. But soon the investigation shows that it was suicide, Adam is released, and Verona shows him what happened to her mother. Adam is a retired and skilled agent from a secret program called Beekeeper and resolves to find the responsible for the death of Eloise.

It is really a ploy to sacrifice himself for the benefit of his wife Maya and brilliant daughter Zora. Zora misses her dad terribly. She frequently uses her ham radio to broadcast her thoughts about the technical projects they used to work on together. The signal is picked up by a surviving group living in a Philadelphia subway station. They send a trio of their community to find Darius's home so they can improve their oxygen generating capacity. The trio of Tess, Lucas and Mike travel the 100 miles in three days hoping to glimpse the Darius technology. They go about approaching for help in entirely the wrong way - through force. Maya does not respond well to their threats of violence in they are not complicit. Eventually, they are able to penetrate through all the security devices that Darius built to protect his family. The technical workings of it are too complicated for them to understand.—Garon Smith",4.2,N/A,"Jennifer Hudson,Milla Jovovich,Quvenzhané Wallis,Sam Worthington,Common,Raúl Castillo,Dan Martin,Kaliswa Brewster,James Saito,Sonya Giddings,Kimberly L.

714,21. Snerting,2024,"A romantic and thrilling story that spans several decades and continents; Touch follows one man's emotional journey to find his first love who disappeared 50 years ago, before his time runs out. In the late 1960s, Kristófer (Palmi Kormákur) is a young Icelander man studying at London School of Economics, but his left-wing beliefs put him at odds with the school administration. After being mocked by his college friends for saying he would drop out, Kristófer impulsively applies to be a dishwasher at Nippon, a Japanese restaurant owned by chef Takahashi, where he meets and falls in love with Miko (Kôki), Takahashi's daughter. Kristófer learns Japanese and works hard at Nippon, earning the trust of Takahashi and Miko. He witnesses Takahashi forcibly break up a relationship between Miko and her boyfriend. Takahashi trains Kristófer as a chef and lets him come in early to practice. As Miko visits Kristófer to taste his cooking, they grow closer and start a relationship, unbeknownst to Takahashi. Miko confides in Kristófer that her family was originally from Hiroshima, and her mother was pregnant with her at the time of the bombing. Facing discrimination back home as 'Hibakusha,' they moved to England. Upon coming back from a holiday, Kristófer is shocked to see that the restaurant has been closed, and the Takahashis have moved away without saying a word, except for one final paycheck addressed to him. Fifty years later, Kristófer (Egill Ólafsson) is now a widower living alone in Iceland. His memory is failing, and his doctor suggests that he should resolve any unfinished business while he still has time and capacity. Kristófer closes his restaurant and sets out to find Miko just when the world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Arriving in London in the midst of pandemic restrictions, Kristófer finds Takahashi's restaurant is now a tattoo parlor. He manages to locate Hitomi, a former employee at Nippon, who tells him that Takahashi and Miko moved back to Japan 50 years ago, and Takahashi has since passed away. She gives Kristófer Miko's last known address. Kristófer visits Miko's (Yôko Narahashi) apartment in Japan. After a moment of hesitation, the two embrace, not having seen each other for over half a century. Miko reveals the reason for her sudden departure: her father always feared that her children would have birth defects from radiation exposure, so he forbade her from having relationships altogether. When he discovered Miko was pregnant with Kristófer's child, he moved her back to Japan, and later forced her to give the child up for adoption. Miko has remained unmarried since, with no other children. Miko then tells Kristófer that their son, Akira (Eugene Nomura), was born a healthy child and happily adopted, and is now a chef with his own restaurant and family. She takes him to Akira's restaurant, where she is a regular customer. Kristófer is overcome with emotion upon seeing his son for the first time, though Akira remains unaware of his biological parents. The film ends with Kristófer and Miko walking down the street hand in hand. As the screen fades to black, he softly sings to her the Icelandic song he sang years ago in a party at Nippon.",7.4,N/A,"Egill Ólafsson,Kôki,Palmi Kormákur,Masahiro Motoki,Yôko Narahashi,Ruth Sheen,Masatoshi Nakamura,Meg Kubota,Tatsuya Tagawa,Charles Nishikawa,Siggi Ingvarsson,Starkaður Pétursson,Akshay Khanna,Kieran Buckeridge,Brandy Row,Benedikt Erlingsson,Maria Ellingsen,Eiji Mihara,Masaya Mimura,Katla M.

834,19. Brothers,2024,"Two criminal twin brothers, one who is trying to reform, embark on a dangerous heist road trip. Facing legal troubles, gunfights, and family drama, they must reconcile their differences before their mission leads to self-destruction. Twin brothers - Moke (Josh Brolin) and Jady (Peter Dinklage) - rob a warehouse, but only Jady gets caught and spends time in prison. While inside, he meets up and strikes deals with connected Correctional Officer Farful (Brendan Fraser) whose crooked court judge father (M. Emmet Walsh) gets Jady sprung from prison. Moke is working at a fast-food restaurant, but is fired because he didn't disclose his criminal past. His wife (Taylour Paige) is pregnant. Farful beats Jady up at his place, and threatens him looking for some emeralds, but doesn't find them. The brothers decide to go on a road trip for the emeralds. The brothers visit Bethesda (an uncredited Marisa Tomei), a lady Jady met online. They meet her pet Orangutan there smoking a cigarette. They visit awhile but decide to leave when the Orangutan sexually harasses Moke. They then stop at a motel, and find their mom (Glenn Close) there. She talks about the heist many years ago when her partner swallowed some emeralds before dying in a car crash. She then buried him and left the country. She now claims to be dying of brain cancer, with less than a year to live. They agree on one last heist to acquire the buried emeralds, now worth $4 million. Meanwhile, Farful gets to Bethesda's place and she tells him about the brothers before Farful gets chased away by the horny Orangutan. Mom and her sons get an excavator and go to the plot, which is now a private golf club, to dig up the body of her deceased crime partner who died with emeralds in his stomach. They get the emeralds but are spotted by golf players. There is an excavator/golf cart high-speed chase, but they manage to get away. They bury the body again in a different location, and Moke discovers that Jady impersonated ""Labor and Employment Bureau"" to get him fired from his job. The brothers fight, but Farful arrives with a gun and demands the emeralds. The mom runs away with the emeralds and they all chase her, but she gets into a car and drives away. Farful drives a car with the brothers in the back seat, but the handcuffed brothers get into another fight and a random kick knocks Farful unconscious. The mom sells the emeralds for cash, but the twins are able to locate her and demand their share of the loot. She runs to an abandoned mall with her kids in pursuit. Farful tracks his car by GPS, appears there with a gun and is able to secure the bag of cash. But when he opens the bag, he is sprayed in the face by pepper spray. As he fires more shots in agony, he hits a propane tank which explodes, the mall giant Christmas tree falls on him and he dies. Hearing the gunshots, the mall is surrounded with cops. The mom takes the gun, tells her sons to flee, and confesses that she's not actually dying. At Judge Farful's house, Moke gives the judge his share of cash in return for his brother's gun with incriminating fingerprints. Moke arrives late for Thanksgiving dinner with his wife and her family, and is joined by Jady, who says he has seen a lawyer and created a trust under Moke's daughter's name for $2 million. A year later, the brothers share a prison Thanksgiving meal with their mom in jail, where she gets to see her new granddaughter. The brothers go outside, and Jady opens his hand to reveal two emeralds, as it shows mom had secretly swallowed them just before being arrested. In the final narration, Jady reveals there was actually three emeralds, and he kept the extra one.",5.4,N/A,"Josh Brolin,Peter Dinklage,Taylour Paige,M.
